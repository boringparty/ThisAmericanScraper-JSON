      <description>Our program's very first broadcast.

Prologue
Ira talks with Joe Franklin , host of the longest running talk show in television history, to get advice for his new radio show. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
After he goes to Jerusalem and sleeps on what is supposedly the very spot where Jesus was crucified, Kevin Kelly has a revelation: that he should live the next six months as if he would die at the end of them. So he gives away nearly everything he owns, and tries to live each day as if his death is imminent — which turns out to be a great challenge. This story was eventually used in a much later program, Shoulda Been Dead. At the time of this interview, Kevin Kelly was executive editor of Wired magazine. Now he's a contributing editor there, and also runs the Cool Tools website . (23 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Ira calls his parents Shirley Glass and Barry Glass in Baltimore to ask them for advice about his new radio show. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three

Act Four
Ira talks with Ed Ryder, who was wrongly imprisoned for twenty years and recently released. The whole time Ryder was in prison, he dreamt of starting up a band. Now, out of prison, he's done just that. Ira asks him if music means different things to him now that his future is more his own. We replayed his rendition of "God Bless the Child" in the show Lockup. (9 minutes)

      <description>When comedianJulia Sweeneyand her brother both got cancer, she decided to tell the story the best way she knew how: in a comedy club. It might seem like a strange choice, but what resulted is halfway between standup comedy and true-life diary entries.

Prologue

Act Two
In the second half of the show, she talks about her own cancer — cervical cancer that was diagnosed six months after her brother got sick. Julia eventually turned some of these vignettes into a one-woman show called God Said, Ha! , which Quentin Tarantino made into a movie and Julia released as a book . The comedy club where she performed, Un-Cabaret, is devoted to getting very funny people to tell unusually honest stories. Julia's latest one-woman show is called Letting Go of God , excerpts of which are heard in our episode Godless America . (25 minutes) _Julia Sweeney_

      <description>What unites these stories on the surface is that they're all made from old tapes, recordings found in attics and thrift stores. What unites them under that surface — and not far under it — is that they all end up being stories about fathers and the legacies that fathers leave their children.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass with some tape he recorded of a high school senior prom. Kids goof around in the car after the prom and get lost looking for a friend's house. This tape, Ira says, has all the qualities you look for as a documentary producer: everyone is acting the way they do when there's no tape recorder present. It's intimate and alive, and the kids reveal who they are. This is the quality of all the tape in this episode, though all of it is tape found in basements and attics and thrift stores. Ira calls these stories "accidental documentaries." (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
A Midwestern family records a "letter on tape" to their son, who is in medical school in California. Three decades later, the recording somehow ends up in a thrift store. The tape gives a complicated portrait of what goes on among the family members. Mother wishes that Father were more religious. Daughter is miffed because Dad won't help her solve her financial problems. Dad tells corny jokes and talks enthusiastically about machines, extrusions and drills used for the family business run from the basement — a business everyone else in the family resents. And after the old tapes, Ira interviews the son they were sending these to, Arthur Davis. (26 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Ira plays tapes of his own father, Barry, who was a radio deejay in the mid-1950s. Barry gave up spinning records when he decided that he couldn't make a decent living at it, and for over a decade he was against his son going into radio, not wanting him to waste time the way he did. (14 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
Nora Moreno with tapes of her father, a pioneer in Spanish-language broadcasting in America. Her mother fell in love with her father because of his poetic character on the radio, but in real life, the very things that attracted her to him over the radio drove them apart. (13 minutes) _Nora Moreno_

      <description>Writer Jack Hitt goes on a search for a mysterious neighbor from his childhood in Charleston, South Carolina, and stumbles onto an epic story of the Old South, the New South, gender confusion, Chihuahuas, and changing values in American journalism.

Prologue
Who are the people we remember as significant figures from our childhood? What is their hold on our imaginations as we age? Ira visits McCosh Elementary on Chicago's South Side, where a man everyone calls "Mr. Lewis" is the surrogate dad for hundreds of kids — a nearly mythic figure. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Jack Hitt's quest to find out the truth about the man who lived down the street from him 30 years ago in South Carolina: Gordon Langley Hall, a.k.a. Dawn Langley Hall Simmons. Gordon was rumored to have had one of the first sex change operations in America, then to have married a black man, then to have borne the black man's child. It was said he had a full coming-out party for his Chihuahua. It was said he had voodoo powers. Jack's father, the editor of the local paper in Charleston, generally refused to publish anything about Dawn because it was too sensational — even after big city papers and network TV crews decided Dawn was news. Jack sets out to find what was true and what was rumor about Gordon Langley Hall, and stumbles onto a sprawling story about changing cultural morés in America. (41 minutes) _Jack Hitt_

Act Two
Two-and-a-half years after Jack Hitt wrote the story that makes up Act One of our show, he returned to the tale of Dawn Langley Simmons. He brings us up to date on his new conclusions. _Jack Hitt_

      <description>Stories about kids being mean to each other, including a mysterious handbook for bullies, a surprising experiment conducted by a teacher who wants to make kids be nice, and a story of youthful backstabbing told by David Sedaris.

Prologue
A first-grader explains to host Ira Glass how bullies become bullies. His explanation: They read a book on how to be a bully. According to his reasoning, how else could you explain why kids are mean to each other? It couldn't be that they're just bad . (2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
David Sedaris reads one of his funniest and most affecting stories from his book Naked before a live audience. As an adolescent boy, David feared he might be a homosexual. He explains how his secret plan was to win the lottery and then hire doctors who would purge him of his homosexual impulses. Sometimes kids in his class at school would taunt the boys they thought were sissies, and when they did, he tried to be the loudest and meanest. He figured if he didn't act that way, they'd all turn on him next. Then he goes away to summer camp and meets a boy named Pete, who seems like an outsider in the same way he is. At first they get close. Then Pete turns on him. Sedaris' latest book is Let's Explore Diabetes with Owls . (26 minutes) _David Sedaris_

Act Two
Original fiction by Ira Sher about a group of children who find a man trapped in a well but decide not to get him any help. First published in the Chicago Review. (17 minutes) _Ira Sher_

Act Three
Author and kindergarten teacher (and MacArthur Genius Grant recipient) Vivian Paley tells the story of an experiment she conducted in her classroom to make children less cruel to each other. She instituted a rule: "You can't say 'You can't play.'" In other words, if two children are playing, and a third child comes over and wants to join them, they can't tell him or her to get lost. They can't reject him or her. This is the cause of unending pain in most classrooms and playgrounds. The experiment was a remarkable and immediate success. (11 minutes)

Recorded at Millie's Orchid Show in Chicago. Thanks to Brigid Murphy. (12 minutes) _Dael Orlandersmith_

Lee maniacally charts obscure Fastbacks facts and calculates statistics. (12 minutes)

Act Four
Ira with Sam Franco, a 72-year-old Chicagoan who spent his life playing and teaching accordion. He never became famous. Never hit it big. He just had the pleasure of making his living in music in a way so many people wish they could but few do. (7 minutes)

      <description>Host Ira Glass and playwright David Hauptschein took out advertisements in Chicago inviting people to come to a small theater with letters they've received, sent, or found.

Act One
People came for two nights and read their letters onstage. Some were funny. Some were poignant. They told a wide range of stories: a heartfelt letter from prison, a hilariously pretentious job letter sent to the New Yorker magazine, a wringingly sincere teenage "should we be more than friends" letter. Four hours of letters were recorded in all. These were edited down to an hour of letters, with a few unusual songs about letters thrown in.

Act One
Radio producer Scott Carrier quit his job at a low moment in his life. His wife left him and took the kids. And he got a job interviewing schizophrenics for some medical researchers. After doing it a while, he began to wonder if he was a schizophrenic himself. Scott is the author of Running After Antelope . (18 minutes) _Scott Carrier_

Act Three
The story of the worst stateside disaster during World War II, at Port Chicago, an ammunition dump for the navy just north of San Francisco.

      <description>Simulated worlds, Civil War reenactments, wax museums, simulated coal mines, fake ethnic restaurants, an ersatz Medieval castle and other re-created worlds that thrive all across America.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass plays clips from Jessica Yu's documentary Men of Reenaction about Civil War reenactments, where the real battle is the one over who is properly authentic and who is not. (5 minutes)

Act One
Host Ira Glass uses Italian author Umberto Eco's essay Travels in Hyperreality as a guidebook to American simulated worlds. Eco says that the urge to create these miniature simulated worlds is a very American impulse — a significant American aesthetic — and one that's not often discussed. Ira visits the Wax Museum at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, stops by a fake coal mine under Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry, and discusses "the poor man's Hearst Castle" — a California hotel called the Madonna Inn. (13 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Writer Jack Hitt discovers that the world of dinosaurs is a man-made creation, a simulated world that may or may not accurately reflect what happened on earth 100 million years ago. Talking with dinosaur experts like Jack Horner (whose work was the basis of much of the film Jurassic Park ), Hitt finds that most of what you think you know about dinosaurs is probably wrong, and that Americans' ideas about dinosaurs go through "fashions" that reflect the national mood: We believed dinosaurs were more aggressive when we were on the brink of World Wars One and Two. And these days we focus on their family values. (16 minutes) _Jack Hitt_

Act Three
Ira takes a Medieval scholar from the University of Chicago, Michael Camille, to Medieval Times — a chain of fake castles where visitors eat Medieval food and drink Medieval Pepsi and watch a supposed recreation of a Medieval jousting tournament. The scholar finds that there are many historical inaccuracies, but that Medieval Times does capture something essential and interesting about the spirit of the Middle Ages. Postscript: Sadly, Michael Camille, the wonderful scholar in this story, passed away in 2002. You can read about Camille at the University of Chicago website , or on the UK's Guardian Unlimited website . Michael's books are still in print, though aimed at an academic audience. The one that touches most directly on the things he talks about on our show is Image on the Edge: The Margins of Medieval Art (Reaktion Books - Essays in Art and Culture) . (19 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Four
Ira Glass worked for NPR's Morning Edition and All Things Considered for seventeen years, and shares a few thoughts on the devices he and his colleagues used to simulate the real world on those shows. (2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>Stories about the border between mental health and mental illness.

Prologue
Story of a romance that began in a mental hospital. Sometimes, the line between crazy and not crazy is blurry; certain behavior could mean either thing. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Susanna Kaysen reads from her account of living at McLean psychiatric hospital for about two years, starting when she was eighteen. Her book, Girl, Interrupted , describes daily life on the ward. (12 minutes) _Susanna Kaysen_

Act Two
Dr Patricia Deegan hears voices in her head. She's a psychologist and she believes that the only way mental health workers can really understand what their patients go through is if they hear voices themselves. So she and a few other voice-hearers put together a tape for mental health workers. It's a simulation of what the voices say and how they sound. She says that she and others actually hear the voices, as if they are voices in the room. Dr Deegan's organization is the National Empowerment Center . (10 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
David Sedaris tells a story from his boyhood, when a voice inside his head commanded him to lick every light switch and tap his forehead with his heel. It's from his book Naked . (14 minutes) _David Sedaris_

      <description>Stories, tributes, and attempts to understand the Chairman of the Board.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass, with a recording of a 1962 Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr., appearance at the Villa Venice, a club outside Chicago. What's fascinating about Sinatra is how he is so many different people at once, and they're all on display in this recording: sentimental crooner, cruel woman-baiter, bully, goofball. The part of the act with Sammy Davis, Jr. is the oddest. Martin and Sinatra are constantly telling him to get off the stage and make joke after joke, whose main point is simply that he's a black man, onstage with two white men. Chicago writer Rennie Sparks makes the case that Sinatra is mesmerizing because he's every man, every possible man, all rolled into one. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Michael Ventura, who grew up Sicilian in New York, says that as a kid he thought Sinatra was in his family. His book The Death of Frank Sinatra is not really about Sinatra. It's about men like Ventura, who drew part of their style and sense of self from Frank. He reads from the only section in the book where Sinatra actually appears: an account of a Sinatra concert, circa 1994. He says he wanted to write about the older Sinatra because the older Sinatra contains all the ages of Sinatra. All of them come forward when he sings. (12 minutes) _Ira Glass, Michael Ventura_

Act Two
Before Sinatra died, Sarah Vowell appeared on this radio program and made a prediction about how network news would cover Sinatra's death ... and she made a simple plea. We hear whether her prediction came true. This essay appears in Sarah's book, Take the Cannoli: Stories from the New World . (9 minutes) _Sarah Vowell_

Act Three
Ira and music contributor John Conners on Sinatra's worst songs. And a brief history of what makes that 1950s Sinatra sound so great, with Will Friedwald, author of the definitive book on Sinatra's music, Sinatra! The Song Is You: A Singer's Art . (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Four
Gay Talese reads from his classic 1966 Esquire article, in which he followed around Sinatra at the height of Sinatra's power. (10 minutes) _Gay Talese_

Act Five
New York writer Camden Joy tells what happened when in a greasy spoon restaurant filled with cabbies and club kids when Frank's film The Manchurian Candidate came on television. The whole place got silent, watched the film, and choked up. Other Sinatra music throughout the show. (9 minutes) _Camden Joy_

      <description>Stories of people changing their name — some to create a new identity, some to con people.

      <description>Stories of when things go wrong. Really wrong. When you leave the normal realm of human error, fumble, mishap, and mistake and enter the territory of really huge breakdowns. Fiascos. Things go so awry that normal social order collapses. This week's show is a philosophical inquiry in the nature of fiascos — perhaps the first ever.

Act One
Writer Jack Hitt tells the story of a small town production of Peter Pan , in which the flying apparatus smacks the actors into the furniture, and Captain Hook's hook flies off his arm and hits an old woman in the stomach. By the end of the evening, firemen have arrived and all the normal boundaries between audience and actors have completely dissolved. (23 minutes) _Jack Hitt_

Act Two
A medieval village, a 1900-pound brass kettle, marauding visigoths, and a plan to drench invaders with boiling oil that goes awry. From Ron Carlson's book The Hotel Eden , read by Chicago actor Jeff Dorchen. (10 minutes) _Ron Carlson, Jeff Dorchen_

Act Three
Wisconsin Public Radio wanted to do something simple: start running Car Talk , the most popular single hour on public radio. But to do this, they had to move their local car show, About Cars , from the morning to the afternoon. The host of About Cars was so upset about this — and what he felt was mistreatment in the past — that he not only refused to move, he started a monthly newsletter about it and organized a public rally. Fifteen hundred people wrote angry letters; 126 swore they'd never give to Wisconsin Public Radio again. The State Legislature got involved. They conducted an audit, which took months. There were hearings. One definition of a fiasco is when something simple and small turns horribly large, and this event fits the bill. We hear from all aggrieved parties, including the Car Talk guys — Tom and Ray Maggliozi. (15 minutes) _Ron Carlson, Jeff Dorchen_

Act Four
Journalist Margy Rochlin on her first big assignment to do a celebrity interview. It was 1982. The interviewee was Moon Unit Zappa, who had just released "Valley Girl" with her father, Frank. She'd only been interviewed once. Midway through the interview: fiasco! Margy chokes on some coffee, which pumps out of her nose. Moon's mother administers the Heimlich Maneuver. And after that, everyone's so relaxed that Margy gets an interview that becomes her first syndicated article and a big scoop for her paper. When a fiasco destroys social boundaries, it can bring people together. (7 minutes) _Margy Rochlin_

      <description>Stories of people trying to get rich quick or otherwise make something for nothing. As everyone knows, there's no such thing as something for nothing. You always pay a price.

Act One
A contest held every year by a Nissan dealership in Longview, Texas in which twenty-four people stand around a $15,000 hard body pickup truck. When the starting whistle blows, each person puts one hand on the truck. They wear gloves, so as not to mess up the paint job. And they stand there ... and stand there ... until one by one, people get tired and drop away, and one person is left standing. That person gets to keep the truck. Excerpts from a documentary ( Hands On A Hard Body ) by filmmakers Rob Bindler, Chapin Wilson and Kevin Morse. We hear a long interview with Benny Perkins, who won the truck one year and was back the year they made their film to try to win again. He says a contest like this is not easy money. You slowly go crazy from sleep deprivation. (17 minutes) _Rob Bindler, Kevin Morse, Chapin Wilson_

Act Two
Ira interviews Bob Helms, creator of the zine Guinea Pig Zero, which is about people who make their living by donating their bodies to science for medical experiments. Bob says he wouldn't do spinal tap studies or psychoactive drugs (he calls the people who do the latter "brain sluts"). Overall, he says, it's a much better job than most nine-to-fives. (8 minutes)

Act Three
Writer Dirk Jamison, who gave up a 9-to-5 job and succeeded in getting something for nothing: he decided he'd feed the family by diving into dumpsters for free food. His father's very zen attitude about this, and how it affected the family. Dirk is the author of Perishable: A Memoir . (16 minutes)

Act Four
Hollywood is all about the idea of getting something for nothing, and no show on the subject would be complete without a Hollywood story. Writer Sandra Tsing Loh provides it. (8 minutes)

      <description>Notes and stories about the Canadians among us. Are they in fact any different from red-blooded Americans? They claim they're not. Skeptical Americans put their position to the test.

Act One
David Rakoff on how he tried to pass as a local once he moved from Toronto to New York. He claims that there must be a chip in his head — or something like it — that automatically tells him when someone or something famous is Canadian. Lorne Greene? Canadian. The American space shuttle? It has a Canadian-built arm. (10 minutes) _Ira Glass, David Rakoff_

Act Two
Canadians not getting any respect in two locales: A town called Little Canada, Minnesota; and in Canada, where a guy doing a Canadian-heritage art project gets ribbed by his neighbors, who joke that there is no Canadian culture to celebrate. Then, Sarah Vowell speaks with Ian Brown, formerly the host of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's long-running program Sunday Morning. They arm wrestle over what it means to be a Canadian, what it means to be an American, and whether the two are the same. (18 minutes) _Sarah Vowell_

Act Three
Or is that "Ooting?" 90210 expert Danny Drennan on the pro-Canadian bias in the hit TV show Beverly Hills 90210 now that Canadian Jason Priestly is not just a star of the show, but a producer and director as well. Then writer Jack Hitt dissects the pro-Canadian bias in ABC's World News Tonight. (3 minutes) _Danny Drennan, Jack Hitt_

Act Four
A tale of two siblings — separated, but not at birth. Reporter Paul Tough and his sister grew up in Toronto, the most American of Canadian cities. Then she moved to more remote parts of Canada. He moved to Manhattan. He talks to her about whether she even considers him Canadian anymore, and about what it means to be Canadian. Assorted Canadian music throughout the hour. (7 minutes) _Paul Tough_

      <description>A show for July 4th weekend. We begin with perhaps the most moving, poetic inaugural speech in American history, and look at its legacy today. In his second inaugural address, Lincoln wondered aloud why God saw fit to send the slaughter of the Civil War to the United States. His conclusion: that slavery was a kind of original sin for the United States, for both North and South, and all Americans had to do penance for it.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass explains that today's show begins in 1865 and ends today. Ira reads briefly from Lincoln's Second Inaugural address, which describes slavery as America's Original Sin of sorts. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>When you read other people's mail, you can't help but try to fill in between the lines. You try to decipher the stories of the people who wrote the letters. We hear four stories of people who read other people's mail, and what happens to them once they get caught up in these other lives.

Prologue
Pete found a bag of maybe a hundred letters in a dumpster and found himself completely wrapped up in the lives of the two people in the letters. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Richard Lyons, from the band Negativland , tells the story of a Xeroxed book he put together for a few friends. It's photos of smashed-up cars in a junkyard. Next to each crumpled car is reprinted the text of a note or letter or list found in the car. The effect is poignant. Lyons describes the photos and reads from the notes and letters found in the cars. (10 minutes) _Richard Lyons_

Act Two
There can be consequences for reading other people's mail. Fiction writer Mona Simpson reads an excerpt from her short story Lawn. (12 minutes) _Mona Simpson_

Act Three
If you work for the post office and read other people's mail, you can lose your job or go to prison. Unless you work at a Mail Recovery Center. There are three. The postal workers there open mail that's otherwise undeliverable, for a good cause: to see if they can find any clues on where to deliver it. Paul Tough visits the Mail Recovery Center in St Paul. Find out about auctions of unclaimed mail at the Mail Recovery Centers at the U.S. Postal Service website . (15 minutes) _Paul Tough_

Act Four
Sarah Vowell puts her foot down. She says that contrary to all the wide-eyed voyeurs we've heard up until this point in the program, reading other people's mail is wrong, simply wrong. To test her theory, she visits a world class collector of other people's mail and other stuff, who not only collects other people's mail, he also saves grocery lists he picks up off the ground, gum that's been chewed by minor celebrities, and those little pads of squiggles where you try out the pens in the art supply store. (9 minutes) _Sarah Vowell_

Prologue
Host Ira Glass with Walt Strommer, on Dreams of Disabled People. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Photographer Joel Meyerowitz decided to go on a last big trip with his father, Hy, who has Alzheimer's. Joel also brought his own son. The purpose of the trip? To try to get close to a part of Hy's personality that Alzheimer's had eradicated, and to see if it might be possible to jump start some of his memories. Joel and his son decided to make a movie of the trip. We hear some of the very funny, very moving raw footage. The film, Pop , aired on the PBS program Frontline . (32 minutes) _Joel Meyerowitz_

Act Two
A hemophiliac teenager who tries to set world records and to motocross. (13 minutes) _Tom Andrews_

      <description>An idiosyncratic first-person travelogue about race relations and tourism from radio producer Rich Robinson and television producerJosh Seftel. Their radio story is about a trip they took to the new South Africa. Rich Robinson is black. Josh Seftel is white. The interracial pair travel through the still mostly-segregated society and have very different opinions about what they see, especially when it comes to some distant relatives of Josh's in South Africa.

Prologue
More than England, or Japan or Israel.... When we think of South Africa, it's a more interesting mirror of the United States than nearly any country, because we glimpse a distant echo of the most frightening parts of American society — and the most inspiring. In this prologue, we hear excerpts from a speech Robert Kennedy gave in South Africa in 1966 and an interview with South Africa writer Lewis Nkosi , who remembers how black South Africans imitated black Americans and looked to the American experiment for hope — as many Americans now look to South Africa for hope. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
The first part of Josh Seftel and Rich Robinson's documentary about South Africa. Josh meets people who may be distant South African relatives. He likes them. But because his black friend is with him, he's very nervous that they might be racists. Quizzing them at length at dinner, he finds that one of them is one of Nelson Mandela's doctors. Their kids were very active in the struggle against apartheid. Rich, however, is disturbed by the way they talk about their servants and talk to their servants, and the way they talk to him. Figuring the only way they'll get along again is if they hit the road and get away from Josh's relatives, they start a trek across South Africa, first stopping in an African village. (22 minutes) _Rich Robinson, Josh Seftel_

Act Two
Josh Seftel and Rich Robinson's trek across South Africa continues. They head to the "South African Woodstock" and to a group that's half Nancy Reagan's "Just Say No" campaign and half terrorist campaign. They have more fights about what they're seeing. They have another set of encounters with Josh's family — these far more ambiguous in their meaning. Rich's opinion softens. Josh's changes too. (26 minutes) _Rich Robinson, Josh Seftel_

      <description>The darker side of the art world: petty jealousies, competitiveness, failure. And also what's so great about art.

Prologue
Foreign correspondent Jim Biederman reports from a cell phone inside the Louvre, in front of the Mona Lisa, on what people say while they're standing in front of some of the world's greatest works of art. It turns out to be pretty banal. People talk about dinner. And the price of the paintings. It actually makes you feel bad for artists — a group most of us feel no sympathy for whatsoever. After all, it takes years to develop artistic skills; it's intensely competitive; almost no one makes any money doing it; there are jealousies and unfair treatment; and then, if, somehow, your work is recognized and you end up in a museum like the Louvre, you're even treated badly there. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Reporter Paul Tough talks with Aaron Hsu-Flanders, an acknowledged master in the field of animal balloons, who says that artistic jealousies have ruined his life. Even in the world of latex giraffes and doggies, there are artistic rivalries and bitterness. (10 minutes) _Paul Tough_

Act Two
David Sedaris recounts his shameful career as a performance artist. Recorded before a live audience by KUOW Seattle. (14 minutes) _David Sedaris_

Act Three
Ellery Eskelin never met his father but always heard he was a musical genius. Years after his father's death, Ellery started finding recordings of his musical output: he was the king of "song-poems." These are the songs that result when people answer those ads in the backs of magazines that say, "Send us your lyrics, and we'll write and record your song." Ellery's father's musical output was prodigious — and very odd. An accomplished jazz saxophonist and jazz snob, Ellery listened to his father's tunes, and his own musical taste started to change. (17 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Four
After all this doom and gloom about the difficult lives of artists, we end the show with a more hopeful story from Joel Kostman, a New York City locksmith, who tells us about an incident that happened to him on the job. Joel is author of Keys to the City: Tales of a New York City Locksmith . (8 minutes) _Joel Kostman_

      <description>Stories of the kindness of strangers and where it leads. Also, the unkindness of strangers and where that can lead. All of today's stories take place in the city most people think of as the least kind city in America: New York.

Prologue
Brett Leveridge was standing on the subway. A guy comes walking down the platform, stopping in front of each passenger and delivering a quiet verdict: "You're in. You're out. You, you can stay. You — gotta go." Most people ignored the guy. But Brett found himself, against his will, hoping the guy would give him the thumbs up, and when the guy does, it's thrilling in a very small way: a tiny kindness from a stranger. Brett's story also appears on his website Brettnews , and you can see a graphic recreation of it in our comic book How to Make Radio . (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
New York City locksmith Joel Kostman tells the story of an act of kindness he committed, hoping for a small reward. From his book: Keys to the City: Tales of a New York City Locksmith . (13 minutes) _Joel Kostman_

Act Two
In 1940, Jack Geiger, at the age of fourteen, left his middle-class Jewish home and knocked on the door of a black actor named Canada Lee. He asked Lee if he could move in with him. Lee said yes, and in Lee's Harlem apartment, Geiger spent a year with many of the great figures of the Harlem renaissance: Langston Hughes, Billy Strayhorn, Richard Wright, Adam Clayton Powell. This is what Geiger ended up doing because of that experience. A side note: It turns out there's a movie in which Canada Lee takes a white teenager under his wing and counsels him, as he did for Jack Geiger in real life. The film is called Lost Boundaries . (11 minutes) _Jack Geiger_

Act Three
How two next-door neighbors start treating each other badly, and how, once they start, they become obsessed with each other. Paul Tough reports. (14 minutes) _Paul Tough_

      <description>The mob as portrayed in movies, and as it is in real life. And its hold over us.

Prologue
Danny Toro, a member of a Chicago street gang for ten years, explains what gangster movies he liked most in his gang years and why. Scarface , with Al Pacino, was a good movie to get him pumped up to go out with his boys. A Lucky Luciano film taught him a lesson in how to be more compassionate with members of his own gang. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Writer Sarah Vowell explains why she watched The Godfather every day while she was in college. The film, she says, depicted a world with an understandable moral system to it. She explains what happened when she traveled to Sicily, where scenes in the film were shot. (12 minutes) _Sarah Vowell_

Act Two
Susan Berman, author of the memoir Easy Street, the True Story of a Gangster's Daugher , reads from her book about her father Davie Berman, a Jewish gangster and one of the men — with Meyer Lansky and Bugsy Siegel — who created modern Las Vegas. Act Two continues after the break. More from Susan Berman on her father, who was a cold-hearted mobster by day and a devoted family man at night, just like gangsters in movies like The Godfather. And Terasa, daughter of a New York mafia family. (7 minutes) _Susan Berman_

Act Three
Jerry Capeci, dean of the New York reporters who cover organized crime, on the decline of the mob in recent years. And Alec Wilkinson of the New Yorker magazine, who discusses a photo his wife took of his old neighbors, the Gambino crime family. He lived across the street from John Gotti's mob clubhouse, on Mulberry near Prince, in New York's Little Italy. (15 minutes)

      <description>Can the secular world and the religious world understand each other? We ask that question while visiting Colorado Springs, Colorado, where Pastor Ted Haggard at theNew Life Churchhas put in place a project to pray in front of the home of every person in the city, systematically, block by block and house by house. He's also helped organize a 24-hour, 365-day-a-year "prayer shield" over the city; all-night prayer vigils; and more.

Prologue
Mary and Manfred Rauer have been married 22 years. He's a devout Christian, goes to church every week, reads the Bible every day, was head of his congregation. She's an atheist. They're happy. But there are things they don't understand about each other. How big is the gap of misunderstanding between religious people and secular people? They provide a case study. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Alix Spiegel in Colorado Springs, where a massive prayer project is underway to pray for every person, business, and school. When she arrives, she finds the Christians speak a kind of Christian jargon she does not understand. When she goes to her local contact to discuss it, and to find more sympathetic people to profile, he says that he believes the secular world can never understand what the religious community in Colorado Springs is doing. Alix Spiegel believed the prayers were simply a gesture of goodwill by people toward their neighbors, but soon she finds that in fact, they are something very different. Something medieval. (41 minutes) _Alix Spiegel_

Act Two
Scott Carrier in Salt Lake City with a story about whether it's possible to be a good person if you're not a Christian. (11 minutes) _Scott Carrier_

      <description>The story of Harold Washington, the greatest politician you've probably never heard of, and the white backlash that was set off when he became Chicago's first Black mayor.

Prologue
A look at the Chicago political machine in the days before our story begins.

Act One
A history of the brief mayoral career of Harold Washington, and its lessons for Black and white America, as told by people close to him. Many are activists and politicians: Lu Palmer, Judge Eugene Pincham, Congressman Danny Davis, and then-alderman Eugene Sawyer. There are people from his administration—Jacky Grimshaw and Grayson Mitchell—and some reporters who followed his story: Vernon Jarrett, Monroe Anderson, Gary Rivlin, Laura Washington (who became his press secretary). Harold Washington died on November 25, 1987. This show was first broadcast ten years later, in 1997. (46 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Ira Glass talks with David Axelrod, who was an advisor to Harold Washington and to Barack Obama as 
well. In 2007, when we last broadcast this show, Ira recorded an interview with Axelrod who was riding on Obama’s campaign bus, during the Democratic Primary in Iowa. Axelrod explained that by 2007, the white Chicago wards that didn’t vote for Harold, overwhelmingly came out for Obama. Then, WBEZ reporter Robert Wildeboer talks to some of those voters, in wards where Harold did badly 
in the 80s, about what changed for them. And we hear an excerpt from "Dreams From My Father," where Barack Obama writes about what Chicago
was like in the days after Harold’s death. (11 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>Numbers lie. Numbers cover over complicated feelings and ambiguous situations. In this week's show, stories of people trying to use numbers to describe things that should not be quantified.

Prologue
When she began working as a temp secretary in San Francisco, learning the computers, wasting time, Andrea put together a graph with Microsoft Excel. Its title: My Love Life: A Ten Year Span. It made her feel good. Seeing it all in hard numbers was so much less painful than remembering the actual people she'd been involved with. Numbers are easier to take. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
D. Travers Scott and his boyfriend spent six months gathering data on their own relationship and put together a report on it in the form of a corporate annual report. Their goal: to describe the most emotional parts of life using the least emotional possible format. They say it doesn't work. Real life's too chaotic. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Alex Melamid and Vitaly Komar hired a polling firm to investigate what people want to see in paintings. Then, using the data, they painted what people want. It turned out to be a landscape, with a mountain and a lake, and deer, and a family, and George Washington. Then they applied these techniques to music with composer David Soldier . They surveyed audiences about what kind of instruments and topics they liked most in their songs. Then they produced one song based on what people most want to hear — and one song based on what they hate the most. The one people hate includes bagpipes, children singing, lyrics about holidays and religion, wild volume and tempo changes. If you'd like a copy of the songs featured in this segment, visit Melamid and Komar's website. You can buy both the Most Wanted and Most Unwanted Songs directly from them. (11 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
Jerry Davidson has been keeping a list of everything he's done since 1955 when he was ten years old. What makes it on the lists is very odd, and what isn't included is most of his feelings. His nephew Adam investigates, hoping to understand him better through these lists. He doesn't get very far. (11 minutes) _Adam Davidson_

Act Four
Will Powers — his real name — decided to try to use all the tools of modern brand marketing to sell himself to his own wife. It turned out to help their marriage. (8 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Five
A man tries to calculate what love costs. From Lydia Davis's book Break It Down , read by actor Matt Malloy . (15 minutes) _Lydia Davis, Matt Malloy_

      <description>Stories of who we are on the phone, of things we learn on the phone, and of things that happen on the phone that don't happen anywhere else.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass explains why some old answering machine messages from a decade ago have such power for him: there's a special power to recordings of phone conversations. The phone is intimate — more intimate than a photograph. Even when the person on the phone is a public figure like Lyndon Johnson. He plays some tapes from the Simon & Schuster audiobook of Johnson phone tapes, Taking Charge, The Johnson White House Tapes, 1963-1964 , by Michael Beschloss, to demonstrate. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
The story of a teenager, illegal drug use, lying, stealing, and a kid's life changed completely when he heard how he sounded on the phone. (31 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Sure you can try to get your pop songs onto records, or on the radio, or onto MTV. But what happens if your medium of choice is ... the telephone? Before they had record contracts, the band They Might Be Giants distributed their songs through the medium of Answering Machine. They created their own Dial-a-Song line. They say it taught them a lot about songwriting, because they could hear which songs people hated, because people hung up on the bad songs. It taught them how to do better musical arrangements for their songs. Sarah Vowell visited John Linnell and John Flansberg in Brooklyn and talked to them about Dial-a-Song. (15 minutes) _They Might Be Giants, Sarah Vowell_

Act Three
We think of our phone calls and phone messages as so transient. We have another example of phones recording personal history: this story from Barrett Golding in Bozeman, Montana, comprised of telephone messages about his father. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass, Barrett Golding_

      <description>Stories about those moments when someone tries to tell you a little bit more about themselves than you'd really rather know.

Prologue
Margy's a reporter. When she told her dad that she wanted to write a story about him, he said sure. Then he called back to say that he was "so glad that she wanted to see him without all his masks." She was stunned. She told him she didn't want to see him without all his masks. "Leave the mask on," she said. Her family already talks about all their feelings, what could he possibly come up with? There are certain things you just don't want to know about the people you love. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Margy Rochlin sees a new side of her father when, in his seventies, he becomes a monologist like Spalding Gray. Her dad, Fred Rochlin, is a huge hit. He tells stories about his experiences in World War II and enters worlds his grown children never imagined him in. But sometimes Margy finds herself hearing things she'd just as soon not know about him. Fred went on to compile his stories in the book Old Man in a Baseball Cap: A Memoir of World War II . (31 minutes) _Margy Rochlin_

Act Two
In which Dan Savage, who makes his living writing a nationally syndicated sex advice column, admits that there's one group of people he does not want to discuss sex with. Ever. Sadly, it's a group of people who have his home phone number: his family. With them, he'd prefer to leave the mask on. (11 minutes) _Dan Savage_

Act Three
A story of guys who wear real masks, like superheroes, in their jobs as costumed wrestlers in a kind of Mexican wrestling called Lucha Libre. Writer RJ Smith has them talk about how much smaller they feel, how humiliated, when they have to take the masks off. (10 minutes) _RJ Smith_

      <description>What happens during a "how-to," and what our how-to's say about us. Most how-to's promise that you'll not only learn skills, you'll be transformed.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass with Brooklyn schoolteacher Melissa Cantor, who reads from a how-to manual written by a sixth-grade student. It's about how to protect yourself against unwanted visitors. Like the Wolfman. Dinosaurs. Aliens. We make how-to's to help ourselves believe the world is an orderly place that we can control, even when we can't. And how-to's go back to the very beginnings of our identity as English-speaking people: when it became legal to publish whatever you wanted in England in 1696, the books that immediately became the most popular were how-to's. They explained how — through hard work, education, self-control — you could better yourself and move up into what we think of today as the middle class. And in fact, they appeared before there was a substantial middle class; people read the books and created a middle class. Our identity is bound up in the very idea of "how to" — the notion that it's possible to better yourself, to become a different person. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Ira teaches Sarah Vowell how to drive with some advice from Tom and Ray Maggliozi, the hosts of NPR's Car Talk. It turns out that although we think of how-to's as the most rational thing in the world — follow the simple instructions and you'll learn — in real life, they're anything but simple. (26 minutes) _Ira Glass, Tom and Ray Maggliozi, Sarah Vowell_

Act Two
A how-to by Junot Diaz, from his book Drown . (11 minutes) _Junot Diaz_

Act Three
In which we tackle the biggest possible how-to we could think of: how to make your life worth more. And we get answers — real, practical answers — from the people whose job it is to think about this issue: insurance adjusters. Adam Davidson reports. (12 minutes) _Adam Davidson_

      <description>How should we react to people who are in non-monogamous relationships? What should we think of these struggles with monogamy?

Prologue
In the early stages of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, there was a period when one of the questions raised by the whole affair had to do with monogamy. Around that time, Roy Romer, the Governor of Colorado and Chair of the Democratic Party, admitted that for 16 years he'd had a relationship with an aide that his wife and family knew about. We hear tape from Romer's remarkable press conference in which he urged people to talk more realistically about how they really live in their marriages, instead of pretending they are monogamous. Northwestern University scholar Laura Kipnis , author of an article in Critical Inquiry about fidelity and monogamy in public life, says we have to examine why so many couples are deserting monogamy. It's a social revolt, she says, like wildcat strikes. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Chris and Sylvere, and how they tried to contain a marriage-threatening crush, and how difficult that is. (26 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Writer and nationally syndicated sex columnist Dan Savage explains what actually happens in non-monogamous couples, how they make it work, and whether they're happy. (9 minutes) _Dan Savage_

Act Three
Ian Brown of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on the normal struggle most people experience when they try to stay monogamous. (13 minutes) _Ian Brown_

A high school student named Rebecca tells the story of a friend of hers who changed over the course of four years from a preppy alternative kid to a member of the Latina clique to a ghetto girl to a Clueless girl (a girl who models herself after the girls in the film and TV show Clueless ). It's hard to imagine many boys changing style this quickly, this willfully, this many times. It's very girl, transforming yourself head to toe every year just because you can, and because you're expected to be that obsessed with how you look. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
David Sedaris with a parable of the pressures on modern women, and how one woman — his sister — responded. David's father thought it was very important that his daughters be thin.

Act Four
Ira with Elizabeth Joseph, who is in a polygamous marriage with eight wives and one husband. She says polygamy is the ultimate feminist lifestyle. Ms. Joseph and her sister-wives are all modern working women.. (10 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>For the 100th episode ofThis American Life, a radio show about the pleasures of radio. About what makes radio so great, and what makes it so terrible.

Prologue
Ira talks about those ephemeral, thrilling radio moments that you happen to catch in passing on stations far away that you never find again. Flipping through the channels. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Iggy Scam describes how he searched for an illegal radio station that keeps appearing and disappearing and appearing again in the mist. (11 minutes) _Iggy Scam_

Act Two
Jack Hitt talks about a radio station he chanced upon while on a long drive. The station seems to ignore the last six decades of broadcasting history and convention. Jack is the author of Off the Road: A Modern-Day Walk Down the Pilgrim's Route into Spain . (10 minutes) _Jack Hitt_

Act Three
How the science of radio enabled V103 to become tied for number one in the Chicago market. And how it cost DJ Ida Hackele her job. (18 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Four
Now in exile, Jose Ramos Horta spent two decades as the leading international spokesman against the invasion of his country by Indonesia. He won a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. And one day when peace finally comes to his country, East Timor, he will move on to his next dream: to be a radio talk host, just like Howard Stern. (10 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>The story of Niagara Falls, a town that started with something huge—the falls—and built nothing lasting from it. During this hour, a special edition of our show: Stories about Niagara Falls, half of them from documentary producerAlix Spiegel, who went to the Falls and interviewed people living there; and half from playwrightDavid Kodeski, who grew up in the town of Niagara Falls.

Prologue
The modern history of Niagara Falls can be divided roughly into three phases: Schemers who came in trying to exploit the Falls for tourism and failed; schemers who came in and tried to exploit the Falls for hydroelectric power, who've all gone; and the people who are left in Niagara today. Our show is about this last group: People who live in the aftermath. Some of them have made their peace with what Niagara has become, some haven't.

Act One
Reporter Alix Spiegel and playwright David Kodeski tell stories about Niagara Falls. During the hour we hear from Paul Gromosiak, a man who's obsessed with the Falls, writes about them, thinks about them all the time, but never goes there, because "they've ruined the falls." We hear a man who went over the falls in a barrel, and we hear the recordings he made inside the barrel as he went over. There's a man who picks up the bodies of people who've jumped over the Falls. A man who holds 2,000 weddings a year for tourists. And we hear David Kodeski's story—of growing up near the Falls, working as a tour guide, and being urged to work in the chemical plants where wages were higher. In all, nine different stories, interwoven. David Kodeski's portion of this show was based on his one-man play Niagara (You Should Have Been Yosemite) , which played originally at the neo-futurarium in Chicago—home of the great neo-futurists. _David Kodeski, Alix Spiegel_

      <description>With so many songs, movies, and books about the joy of the open road, it's hard to take just a normal road trip without huge expectations.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with a guy who hit the road after his mother's death, hoping for some experience that would change him and shed light on what just happened. This never happens to him, or to most of us. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
What happens when being on the road is your job, and has been your job for decades? Reporter Margy Rochlin recalls a trip she took with 92-year-old George Burns and his tiny entourage. (17 minutes) _Margy Rochlin_

Act Two
A road trip can be a profound test of any relationship. It can save a marriage or destroy it. We have this example of a road trip in Europe. Playwrights Candido Tirado and Carmen Rivera told the story at the Nuyorican Cafe in New York City as part of an evening of "traveling stories" organized by The Moth . (14 minutes) _The Moth, Carmen Rivera, Candido Tirado_

Act Three
Dishwasher Pete, an itinerant dishwasher and author of the book Dishwasher: One Man's Quest to Wash Dishes in All Fifty States , loves taking the bus as he moves from city to city every few weeks. In this act, he takes a tape recorder with him, hoping to capture the stories he always hears from his fellow passengers. It completely ruins his feelings about the bus. (16 minutes) _Dishwasher Pete_

Act Four
What we want on the road — many of us — is adventure. And what is adventure but a moment you never could've predicted before you left home? Chicago writer Cheryl Trykv tells the story of one such moment. Songs: "Happy Trails" and " One More Mile ," Dave Dudley (7 minutes) _Cheryl Trykv_

      <description>An NPR reporter leaves her three-year-old son and heads to Omaha—for cancer treatment—a last chance to save her life. After years of covering stories about medicine, Rebecca Perl enters the hospital as a patient. She moves from the world of healthy people into the world of sick ones. What she sees and what she learns.

Prologue
Ira Glass talks about a man named Paul Cowan, who wrote a story about becoming ill for The Village Voice .

Act One
After years of covering stories about medicine, NPR Reporter Rebecca Perl enters the hospital as a patient. She moves from the world of healthy people into the world of sick ones. What she sees and what she learns. This piece, which was produced by Dan Collison for Long Haul Productions , received the Edward R. Murrow Award from the Radio Television News Directors Association (RTNDA) in the summer of '99. It got a perfect score, with one judge saying it was the best documentary he'd ever heard.

      <description>What's frustrating about music lessons, what's miraculous about them, and what they actually teach us. This show was recorded in front of a live audience at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, with help fromKQED-FM, during the 1998 Public Radio Conference in San Francisco.

Prologue
Durrell was a professional musician. He toured Asia, Brazil, Canada, gigs in Paris. Now he teaches chorus at a high school on Chicago's south side. Touring was easier. Durrell explains the frustrations of being a music teacher. We hear him try to cancel the last concert of the year...and how his students try to change his mind. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
A case study of how children are asked to live the unlived lives of their parents. Author David Sedaris had a father who loved jazz but played no instrument himself. Instead, he dreamt that his children would learn to play and form a little jazz combo. He sent David to take guitar lessons. David, however, had dreams of his own. David's most recent book is Let's Explore Diabetes With Owls . (15 minutes) _David Sedaris_

Act Two
As a teenager, Sarah Vowell was not casual about music lessons — music became her life. She was in marching band, jazz band, Band One, symphony band, pep band and the Bozeman Recorder Ensemble. Here Sarah recalls all the things she learned in music class that had nothing to with music. Sarah's most recent book is Unfamiliar Fishes . (17 minutes) _Sarah Vowell_

Act Three
Writer Anne Lamott presents an example of what we can learn from music outside of formal classes. She tells the story of an airplane trip, a song, and a small miracle. Anne's most recent book is Help, Thanks, Wow . (18 minutes) _Anne Lamott_

      <description>Two stories of people who try to cross the color line — and why it's still so hard. We hear the story of a failed interracial marriage and the story of a teenager from a poor inner city neighborhood (Cedric Jennings, pictured) who ends up at an Ivy League University — and how he barely survives there.

Prologue
Ira reads from an editorial from a 1957 newspaper in Jackson, Mississippi. It tries to scare white southerners about the NAACP by describing a Chicago human rights campaign called "Take a Negro Boy Home Tonight." The idea behind the campaign? "Racism can be combated by intimate relationships between Negro boys and white girls." No such campaigns really existed in Chicago. Ira explains that in this show we hear from two people who tried to do what southerners feared so much. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Rich Robinson's father is black, his mother is white. They married during the civil rights movement, believing the whole nation was moving toward greater and greater integration. After having three children, they divorced. Rich's mom went back to her segregated white world. His dad returned to his segregated black world. In this story, Rich sets out to discover the role that race played in their divorce and the role it played in their initial attraction. It's something he'd never discussed with them before. And he wants something more personal: advice on whether they think he should marry white or black. (32 minutes) _Ira Glass, Rich Robinson_

Act Two
Cedric Jennings grew up in Southeast Washington, in one of the poorest communities in the country. Wall Street Journal reporter Ron Suskind followed him for over two-and-a-half years, as Cedric tried to make it through high school and work his way into an Ivy League university. Once he gets there, he discovers that all the qualities that got him out of the ghetto make him an outcast in the Ivy League. Ron Suskind's reports on Cedric for the Wall Street Journal won a Pulitzer Prize; his book about him is called A Hope in the Unseen: An American Odyssey from the Inner City to the Ivy League . (21 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>For this Father's Day, stories in which fathers and their kids sit down and try to have an honest moment together. And stories about fathers who aren't close with their kids.

Prologue
We ask 18-year-old Chana Wiliford and her father in Texas if they'd be willing to have a conversation on tape in which each of them gets to ask the other the questions they've never asked before. In the conversation, Chana is half his child, half his peer. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
More tape of Chana and her father Bob Wiliford discussing all the things they've never talked about before. Though Chana grew up in Waco, Texas, she left to go to college in Philadelphia. Her dad works for the phone company. Her parents have been married and divorced and re-married to each other three times, but she doesn't understand why. In this interview, she gets to ask about it. (7 minutes) _Chana Wiliford_

Act Two
In this part of the show, stories about fathers who haven't gotten quite so close with their children. Two-thirds of all African American children are raised in single parent homes, usually by mothers and/or grandmothers. Sanantonio Brooks is 18 and lives in a big Chicago public housing project. He wanted to interview some of the young fathers in his building, guys his age who he's known since he was a kid — guys who had kids as teenagers. He wanted to talk about whether they are better fathers than their own fathers were. (12 minutes) _Sanantonio Brooks_

Act Three
Another case study of a dad who's waiting to feel closer to his kid. Writer Dan Savage writes the syndicated sex advice column Savage Love. He and his boyfriend Terry spent months trying to adopt and finally adopted a baby boy. Terry, who has a heart of gold, bonded right away. For Dan, it's taking longer. And to people who fear the very idea of gay couples bringing up a baby boy, Dan has this message: he and Terry are like a traditional 1950's couple. Dan goes off to earn the money; Terry stays at home and raises the kid. (10 minutes) _Dan Savage_

Act Four
This is a story about an odd breach of trust between father and child, done unintentionally, and what happens next. Lawrence Weschler is an author and journalist. He and his 11-year-old daughter Sara tell the tale. She believed that she saw a four-inch tall human being, a little girl, like she read about in the children's books The Borrowers . She began leaving treats and notes for this girl. She was upset when the girl didn't seem to take them, and, finally, her father took them and wrote her a note back, pretending to be the 4-inch-tall girl. (23 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>WriterSarah Vowelland her twin sister re-trace the "Trail of Tears" — the route their Cherokee ancestors took when expelled from their own land by President Andrew Jackson. On the way, Sarah and her sister visit the land they would have grown up in had the Cherokees not been expelled, Andrew Jackson's home, and the land in Oklahoma where the Cherokee nation settled (and where Sarah and her sister were born). They reflect on their own American-ness and Cherokee-ness, and on the more difficult question: What's history good for, anyway?

Prologue
Host Ira Glass describes what thousands of people do all over America on our holiday weekends: we go to historic sites with our kids and stare at bricks and statues, trying to feel some connection with the past. It's not easy. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Sarah Vowell and her twin sister Amy re-trace the Trail of Tears. They visit the town in Georgia that was the capital of the Cherokee Nation before the Cherokee were expelled. They enjoy a tourist trap hotel in Chatanooga. They go to Ross's Landing, the embarkment point for the water route of the Trail of Tears. (28 minutes) _Sarah Vowell_

Act Two
Sarah Vowell's story continues. She and Amy visit the home of President Andrew Jackson, the villain in the Trail of Tears drama. They drive west to Cherokee graves in Kentucky and a commemorative marker that's been placed, oddly, at an Arkansas high school. They head into Oklahoma, where the Cherokee settled and where they were born. Sarah talks with her oldest living relative about the Trail. And she and Amy end their trip at the place where they first heard about the Trail of Tears: an amphitheater where every summer they saw a dramatic two-hour re-creation of the Trail. (23 minutes) _Sarah Vowell_

      <description>People who love summer camp say that non-camp people simply don't understand what's so amazing about it. We attempt to bridge this gap of misunderstanding between camp people and non-camp people.

Prologue
Camp kids explain how their non-camp friends and their non-camp loved ones have no idea why camp is the most important thing in their lives. Most of this hour takes place at a pair of camps in Michigan—Lake of the Woods, a girls camp, and Greenwoods, a boys camp. The two camps share facilities and activities and essentially function as one camp . (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
David Himmel is a college sophomore and a former camper who became a counselor. He says all the best experiences of his life have been at camp or with camp people. We follow him around and discover why. He creates songs that become camp traditions. He has his own fan club of four thirteen-year-old girls. He coaches one of the boys in his cabin when the boy wants to try and kiss a girl he likes. David is the author of A Camp Story: The History of Lake of the Woods & Greenwoods Camps . (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Sure, kids today are sophisticated. But get them living in the woods for a few days, and they revert to some of the most stupidly primitive forms of entertainment known since the dawn of civilization. Specifically: they love scary stories. Every camp has a camp ghost story. We hear one. And we go with the Sioux cabin of ten year olds as they try an experiment in fear, in the dark, in front of a mirror in their cabin.. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
We asked listeners to call and write with their camp stories. Hundreds did. We hear a selection. (7 minutes) _Listeners Like You_

Act Four
Camp Lake of the Woods holds a fake Indian powwow during the summer. This kind of fake Native American-ness has been a part of camping in America since organized camping began a century ago. And ceremonies like this are just part of making the business run for any camp. By having traditions and lots of songs in which campers sing about their loyalty to their own camp, camps create repeat customers. It's an economic imperative. Of course, it's also really fun. Read more about the history of Indian "traditions" in summer camps in Philip Joseph Deloria's Playing Indian . (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Five
NPR's Adam Davidson tells a true story from his own childhood. He was sent to a camp run by the Israeli army at its own training facility. He shot an M-16, sure, but in other ways, army life was amazingly similar to other summer camps: It was all about loyalty to your group, loyalty to your team. Adam is one of the founders of NPR's Planet Money . (7 minutes) _Adam Davidson_

Act Six
This American Life producer Julie Snyder reports on a three-day competition called "Color Days." It's most kids' favorite time at camp — despite the fact that the girls, at least, spend most of the three days crying and screaming. It's thrilling to be part of a team at this level of intensity. Original harmonica music throughout the hour by Howard Levy . (18 minutes) _Julie Snyder_

      <description>Five ways of mapping the world. One story about people who make maps the traditional way — by drawing things we can see. And other stories about people who map the world using smell, sound, touch, and taste. The world redrawn by the five senses.

Prologue
Ralph Gentles and five other people spent each summer creating a map of every crack, every depression, every protrusion, every pothole in the sidewalks of New York City. We hear why, and we hear all the things their map does not include. Map making means ignoring everything in the world but the one thing being mapped, whether it's cracks in sidewalks or the homes of Hollywood stars. And, according to cartographer Denis Wood, we live in the Age of Maps: more than 99.9 percent of all the maps that have ever existed have been made in the last 100 years. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Denis Wood talks with host Ira Glass about the maps he's made of his own neighborhood, Boylan Heights in Raleigh, North Carolina. They include a traditional street locator map, a map of all the sewer and power lines under the earth's surface, a map of how light falls on the ground through the leaves of trees, a map of where all the Halloween pumpkins are each year, and a map of all the graffiti in the neighborhood. In short, he's creating maps that are more like novels, trying to describe everyday life. In 2010, Denis compiled these maps into the book Everything Sings . See an excerpt from the book, including the introduction by Ira Glass, here . (8 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Jack Hitt visits Toby Lester, who has mapped all the ambient sounds in his world: the hum of the heater, the fan on the computer. Jack's most recent book is Bunch of Amateurs . (12 minutes) _Jack Hitt_

Act Three
A story about a device that charts the world through smell — and only smell. TAL producer Nancy Updike visits Cyrano Sciences in Pasadena, California, where researchers are creating an electronic nose. (11 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Four
Deb Monroe reports on how she has been mapping her own body through her sense of touch. (10 minutes) _Deb Monroe_

Act Five
Los Angeles Times food writer Jonathan Gold goes to the places on Pico Boulevard in Los Angeles that he visited back in the early 1980s. He tells the story of how he decided to map an entire street using his sense of taste, and how doing this changed his life. (13 minutes) _Jonathan Gold_

      <description>Germs, and how they make us leave the world of rational thinking.

Prologue
The story of a White House scandal from the year 1881. President James Garfield lay dying of a gunshot wound during that summer. But because our nation is crazy when it comes to the President, and because the White House is a national movie screen onto which we project a whole array of fears and misplaced idealism, Americans projected one of the big fears of the day onto Garfield. Namely, the fear of sewer gas. Rumors abounded that Garfield was not dying from the bullet in his back, but from vapors rising from the antiquated White House toilets. It became so serious that an independent expert was brought in to give a bipartisan assessment of the problem. The Senate voted to spend $300,000 to build a new White House, a sanitary one, right next to the original White House. And it would be nice to believe that all of this was the kind of hysteria that was only possible before the germ theory of disease was proven. But in fact, now we know how diseases are transmitted. Now that we know that there's no such thing as "sewer gas." But still, when it comes to germs, and our fear of disease, we are still irrational beings. Ira talks with Nancy Tomes, author of a history on the subject, The Gospel of Germs . (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Reporter Hanna Rosen did an investigation of those new antibacterial products—the antibacterial soaps and lotions, the antibacterial pizza cutter and linen and underwear. In her article, she mocked these products as ineffective. She mocked the people who used them. And then, she found herself seized with a kind of anti-germ dementia. (11 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Germs were first understood at the turn of the 20th century and it turns out that the aesthetics of everyday life during this century—the way we dress, the way we groom ourselves, the way we make our homes—are all partly a response to this newfangled idea of germs. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
The burden of keeping germs from hurting us in our everyday lives has fallen mostly on women, from the time science fully understood about the existence of germs. After all, women had to keep the home clean, had to prepare food safely. We hear from Emily Colas's funny and disturbingly honest account of her obsession with cleanliness and germs, from her book Just Checking . (5 minutes) _Emily Colas_

Act Four
Reporter, author and apple farmer Frank Browning on how irrational fear of germs means that you aren't going to get good apple cider in your local supermarket this fall. (15 minutes) _Frank Browning_

Act Five
Sean Collins on the germs within us, the germs that can kill us, and the germs that do kill us. He tells the story of the battle with germs that his friend Christopher lost, and contemplates what the germ won when it defeated his friend. (11 minutes) _Sean Collins_

      <description>What happens when you suddenly strike it rich. And the power money has over our lives, for good and bad.

Prologue
Todd Powell won $27 million dollars from the Florida State lottery. The windfall ended his marriage. Strangers and friends kept asking him for money. He couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, lost 26 pounds. Money changes things, and a lot of money changes a lot of things. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Alix Spiegel reports on an entire community that's turned its back on easy money—for now. Nine years ago a native American community in Minnesota—the Mille Lacs band of Ojibwe—built a casino. The reservation had been poor for a century, but soon they were the second biggest tourist attraction in the state, second only to the Mall of America. They had hundreds of millions of dollars...but of course, too much money can be as destructive as too little...and it's unclear what to do with all the cash. (22 minutes) _Alix Spiegel_

Act Two
Seattle writer Dan Savage on how a windfall check he got in the mail is hurting his family life. (11 minutes) _Dan Savage_

Act Three
How one woman learned to stop worrying and start spending. Liz Gilbert and her husband Michael Cooper explain how their different ideas about handling money always divided them—until they stumbled into a $10,000 windfall. (8 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Four
Writer Scott Carrier in Salt Lake City tells the story of someone's life that improved with a huge insurance settlement—even though the money never arrived. (10 minutes) _Scott Carrier_

      <description>Stories of people's last words before death. Their one last shot at figuring things out, summing things up. One last moment of asserting the fact of our existence, at the moment of our annihilation.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass reads famous last words from Bing Crosby, Oscar Wilde, W.C. Fields, and talks about what we want from people's last words. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Sarah Vowell tells the story of Page Smith and Eloise Pickard Smith. They were married for over five decades, and died a day apart. It's a story of people attempting to surround death in a web of words, of very eloquent people and their last words, and of what last words can and cannot accomplish. (13 minutes) _Sarah Vowell_

Act Two
Forty-five people read Luc Sante's story The Unknown Soldier , in which we hear about people's final moments, final thoughts. (7 minutes) _Luc Sante_

Act Four
An act about which the less said, the better.  (12 seconds)

Act Five
We go through transcripts from those black box flight recorders recovered from airplane crashes to see what people say.  One pilot declares "I love you" to someone, another is doing his job like always and suddenly says, "uh-oh." It's an interview with Malcolm McPherson, author of The Black Box: All-New Cockpit Voice Recorder Accounts of In-Flight Accidents . (13 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Six
Writer Tobias Wolff reads his story "Bullet in the Brain" from his collection of stories The Night in Question , about a bank robbery and a man who's shot, and what he thinks about before he dies. (13 minutes) _Tobias Wolff_

      <description>Stories of the first day on the job, the first day in a relationship, the first day in school. On the first day, any first day, we're expected to live by the rules and customs of the culture we're entering, but we don't know those rules and customs just yet. These are stories of people trying to make the transition—and the difficulty of making the transition—in a new place, from outsider to insider.

Prologue
Writer Jack Hitt talks about his daughter Tarpeley's first day in her new school. It was her first "first day" of any kind. The kids at the school put her through a kind of hazing. This often happens at all sorts of first days: in military academies, for doctors-in-training, in street gangs. And why is hazing so common? Hazing is so primal—and intimate. As if the existence of The First Day—the simple presence of an outsider who wants to be an insider—is so profound, so disturbing to any group, that they have to crush you, prove you harmless, before they can bring you in as family. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass, Jack Hitt_

Act One
Dishwasher Pete tells the story of his first day washing dishes on an oil rig off the coast of Louisiana. He'd heard he'd get a hazing when he stepped foot on the rig. How cussing can save you when reason treads, and other lessons of his job there. Listeners who want to buy Pete's zine — where this story first appeared — can get it by sending a dollar to Dishwasher, P.O. Box 8213, Portland, OR 97207. (12 minutes) _Dishwasher Pete_

Act Two
The first day inevitably means mistakes, mishaps, fiascos. A true story, told by a former rookie cop. (14 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
Los Angeles writer Sandra Tsing Loh on the first day of a relationship. A failing relationship. (13 minutes) _Sandra Loh_

Act Four
Then Chicago-radio-listener and writer Alex Blumberg (he's now one of our producers) tells the story of encountering a corporation on its first day. It made all the human errors anyone does on a first day: exhibiting false confidence, pretending it wasn't the first day, trying too hard. (5 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

      <description>For Thanksgiving, the time of year when poultry consumption is highest, it's our annual program about turkeys, chickens, and fowl of all types.

Prologue
When is a chicken your friend? When is he your dinner? This American Life 's former webmeister Elizabeth Meister talks with Kamiko Overs, an 11-year-old girl at the annual poultry exhibition run by the American Poultry Association in Columbus, Ohio. Elizabeth Meister is a producer with Long Haul Productions . (5 minutes) _Ira Glass, Elizabeth Meister_

Act One
Food writer Jonathan Gold tells what it's like to panfry a chicken—with a live chicken watching you the entire time. (14 minutes) _Jonathan Gold_

Act Two
When Francois Mitterand knew he was about to die, he decided that the last food to cross his lips would be poultry...a tiny bird that is actually illegal to eat in France. It's a bird that, by tradition, is eaten with a napkin covering your head. Writer Michael Paterniti set out for France to try the contraband capon himself. (11 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
Last year, a woman named Karen Davis started a national letter writing campaign to try to get This American Life to stop the very program we are broadcasting today—the annual Poultry Slam. In this portion of our show, she explains what it is that we just don't understand about poultry, and why the whole idea of this poultry show was wrong-headed from the start. (10 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Four
Writer David Rakoff explains how his life was changed—in a single evening—in a room of 5000 chickens. (13 minutes) _David Rakoff_

      <description>Stories about seeing and being seen. Taped before a live audience in Town Hall in New York City in December 1998, this was a co-production with WNYC New York, featuring live music by the pop band They Might Be Giants and theThis American LifeOrchestra.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass with Cornell University Professor Richard Klein, on how seeing isn't just seeing. Seeing implies a kind of power over someone else. It's why slaves aren't allowed to look at their masters, why royalty traditionally doesn't like to be seen. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
There are the people who take two hours to get dressed every day, who dress primarily to be seen, and then there are most of the rest of us. Writer Sarah Vowell decides to make the leap into the two-hours group. As part of her lifelong quest to look meaner, she takes lessons in Goth. Goth is the subculture of people who dress in lacy black clothes and dark eye makeup. (15 minutes) _Sarah Vowell_

Ira tells the story of Lucia Lopez, a former gang member who would beat you up if she caught you looking at her...and how her life changed when she put herself in a position where hundreds of people were looking at her. (18 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Writer David Rakoff travels to a place where everyone seems to be looking at him, a place where no one follows the customs people follow back home in New York City, a place called...New Hampshire. Note that many of the They Might Be Giants songs featured in this show are also on their live CD Severe Tire Damage. (17 minutes) _David Rakoff_

      <description>With the number of prisoners in the United States rising rapidly, we present stories of their lives and the lives of their families and children.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass with jazz musician Ed Ryder, who was in prison in Pennsylvania for twenty years for a murder it was later proven he did not commit. Ryder played jazz in the pen and out of the pen. He says playing jazz for inmates is a completely different experience. The culture of prison is completely different, and it even affects how prisoners listen to jazz. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Over two decades ago, not long after he got out of Texas prison for robbery, Ray Hill got a job at his local public radio station, KPFT in Houston. He started a weekly program about Texas prisons that's now the leading muckraking voice in the state when it comes to exposing graft and corruption in prison facilities there. He also does something else that makes it one of the most unusual and remarkable radio programs in the country: For most of an hour, he takes calls from people whose families are in prison; they talk to their loved ones behind bars, over the radio. Ray explains, and we hear clips from his show. (14 minutes) _Ray Hill_

Act Two
As the number of female prisoners climbs, visiting rooms are packed on Mother's Day. Eighty percent of female inmates have children at home. Amanda Coyne has been to a number of these Mother's Days, bringing her nephew to visit his mother and Amanda's sister. Among the difficult moments that come with these visits: What do you say to a five-year-old who wants to know if mommy is a bad guy? (11 minutes) _Amanda Coyne_

Act Three
A reading of a pamphlet written by ex-con Stephen Donaldson for heterosexual men who are about to enter prison, about how to "hook up" with a stronger man —"daddy" or "jocker"—who'll provide protection in return for sex. He explains the rules and mores that govern this part of American prison culture. There's no graphic language and there are no graphic images in this story, but it does acknowledge the existence of sexual acts. Read by Larry DiStasi. (6 minutes) _Larry DiStasi, Stephen Donaldson_

Act Four
What happens when you go into a place—in this case a prison—where there are all sorts of codes about what you're never supposed to say...and you say every one of them. Rick Reynolds tells a story from his one-man show (and CD) All Grown Up and No Place to Go , about performing stand-up comedy at a maximum security prison just before Christmas a few years ago. (6 minutes) _Rick Reynolds_

Act Five
Former South African political prisoner Breyten Breytenbach, on how prison changes all your perceptions in ways that last after you've been released. The painter and poet was interviewed by New Yorker writer Lawrence Weschler for a radio series called Territories of Art, for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles in 1986. Lawrence Weschler used the interviews in writing his book Calamities of Exile. Breytenbach recounts the experiences in his book The True Confessions of an Albino Terrorist. (11 minutes) _Lawrence Otis Graham_

      <description>Three stories of people pretending to be something they're not, and what happens to them.

Prologue
Viola disguises herself as a man, takes a job working for this guy with whom she promptly falls in love. He believes the pretense: He thinks Viola is a man, so he never gives her a second look. This is the problem with pretending: If you're successful, and people actually believe you, you can get stuck in an identity you don't want. The other problem is this: Some people actually come to believe they are the person they're pretending to be. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Ron Copeland is a historical interpreter at the Conner Prairie Living History Museum, outside of Indianapolis. For several months a year, in his job, he pretends to be a slaveowner in the old south. People come looking to experience the slave experience. He screams at them. He bosses them around. And it's starting to change him. (14 minutes) _Alix Spiegel_

Act Two
There's the pretending we do as individuals, and there's the organized pretending that happens in group therapy sessions, in the roleplaying games that are done in some clinical settings. Jack Hitt tells the story of the Mother of All Roleplaying Games. It was in the 1970s and he was there. (11 minutes) _Jack Hitt_

Act Three
Alix Spiegel travels with a group of white suburbanites as they pretend to be runaway slaves, at the Conner Prairie Living History Museum. Her goal: to find out what it is that people actually get out of this elaborate game of pretend. (24 minutes) _Alix Spiegel_

      <description>One thing that makes our country different from most others is this idea that you can re-create yourself as someone you'd prefer to be...sell everything off, head out west, start a new life.  But what happens if you're too good at it?  At throwing everything out and starting over?

Prologue
The tendency toward self-reinvention is so deep in American culture that we have an entire industry, a self-help industry, telling us how to transform ourselves into someone new. And usually, we see this as a positive thing. But what happens if you're too good at it, at throwing everything off, starting over from scratch?

Act One
Over the course of his life, Keith Aldrich was a child of the Depression in Oklahoma; a preacher-in-training in booming California; an aspiring Hollywood actor; in the 1950s, a self-styled Beat writer, and then a man in a gray flannel suit; in the 1960s, a member of the New York literati, and then a hippie; in the 1970s, a denizen of the suburbs with a partying, Ice Storm kind of life. Then in the 80's, when the moral majority helped put Ronald Reagan in office, he became a born-again Christian. Today we're devoting our entire show to story of Keith's life, as told by one of his nine children, Gillian Aldrich. (33 minutes) _Gillian Aldrich_

Act Two
Gillian's story continues. (25 minutes)

      <description>For Valentine's Day, stories of impossible love and heartbreak.

Act One
When Anne Staggs started to fall for an inmate named Charles in the Texas prison system, she was up against odds as daunting as they ever get for two people. It was against the rules, possibly dangerous, and could have gotten her fired. They could never say anything in front of other people and he was—not to put too fine a point on this—a convicted murderer. Still, they married—even though they never see each other. (24 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
A man in Amsterdam and a woman in Cuba fall in love, even though their governments don't want them to live together. This story was produced by Chris Brookes and Michele Ernsting for the World Views series of first person narratives, from Homeland Productions. The editor was Sandy Tolan. It was produced with funds from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and Radio Netherlands. (28 minutes) _Chris Brookes, Michele Ernsting_

Act Three
The story of The Arabian Nights is actually 350 or 400 stories, depending on how you count them. Many of the stories are stories of impossible love, including the very last story in the whole epic tale—the story of Jasmine and Almond. Mary Zimmerman, a Chicago director who adapted The Arabian Nights for stage, explains the story and reads from it. (5 minutes) _Mary Zimmerman_

      <description>Stories of people who choose not to live every moment to the fullest or smell the roses, and instead choose to withdraw from life, to make themselves numb.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass with Robert Lundin, who talks about a time in his life when he felt too alive, and how much more sane he feels now, though his life is less exciting. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Jack Hitt tells the story of Charlene Riling, who nearly died, and who explains how life near to death can be better than everyday life. (21 minutes) _Jack Hitt_

Act Two
When adults talk babytalk to each other, it is precisely to avoid having real conversations and experiencing real moments with each other. People almost never discuss babytalk in public. This American Life producer Nancy Updike and her boyfriend—Chicago journalist Adam Davidson—agreed to step forward and speak the truth on the subject. (12 minutes) _Adam Davidson, Nancy Updike_

Act Three
It's possible to turn off your emotions and go on autopilot for brief periods with the people you love, and it's possible to shut them down completely. Writer Dani Shapiro reads from her memoir Slow Motion: A True Story . (21 minutes) _Dani Shapiro_

      <description>Stories of people moving to this country: what they see and hear about America that those of us who were born here don't necessarily see.

Prologue
Ira goes to the courtroom of Abraham Lincoln Marovitz, who, at 93, presides over the ceremony to make people citizens. In this setting, it's hard to talk about America as it is. Instead, people talk about the America we wish we lived in. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Because of a shortage of math and science teachers, New York City decided to import instructors from Austria. Then the Austrians started to see things about this country that few Americans ever get to see. What they know that you don't know about life in America. David Rakoff reports. (31 minutes) _David Rakoff_

Act Two
This is a story of a father and son—told by the son, Juan Zaldivar, who was born in Cuba. Juan has spent the past four years shooting a movie about his father, to try to reassure him that he did the right thing to leave Cuba with his family in the 1980s and come to America. His father, so far, is not reassured. (20 minutes) _Juan Zaldivar_

      <description>Stories of the end of the world. More people believe it's more imminent than you probably realize.

Prologue
When the end of time comes, what videos will we watch? Under fundamentalist Christian doctrine, the first thing that will happen during the End Time is that all the good Christians will be whisked suddenly to heaven. We hear clips from Left Behind —a video designed to be played after all the Christians have vanished, by all the people left behind. It explains what happened to all the Christians, and what the Bible says about the Apocalypse, the 1000-year reign of Jesus on Earth, the End Time. Videos and books like this are big business now. All of the Left Behind books, including Apollyon : The Destroyer Is Unleashed and Left Behind : A Novel of the Earth's Last Days , both by authors Tim F. Lahaye, Jerry B. Jenkins, with The Vanishings (Left Behind - The Kids) , a novel for kids on the Rapture, also by the same authors, are available through Amazon.com . Visit the extensive Left Behind website for more—and don't miss the Left Behind commercials you can view on this site; they're both riveting and disturbing. You can get more detailed info on all the Left Behind books and videos here, all while you send your email friends electronic postcards featuring graphics inspired by the Rapture. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
How fundamentalist Christians and Orthodox Jews are combining forces to breed a perfect red cow that could bring about the end of the world. Ira talks with cattleman and minister Clyde Lott, and with New Yorker writer Lawrence Wright. (17 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
The story of how an understanding of Bible prophecy by the FBI could have prevented the tragedy at Waco at the Branch Davidians compound. Host Ira Glass with James Tabor, religion professor at the University of North Carolina in Charlotte, who has written a book about the tragic misunderstandings between Koresh and the FBI called Why Waco? Cults and the Battle for Religious Freedom in America. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
How believing in the end of the world can be the best thing that ever happens to you. Writer Sarah Vowell talks about three end-of-the-world groups she comes to know. (16 minutes) _Sarah Vowell_

Act Four
Both Bonnie Gaunt and Marilyn Agee have been counting the length of time of all the events in the Bible, and through their calculations, they believe they have individually discovered the exact day that good Christians will be raptured directly to heaven. Bonnie's date: September 11, 1999; Marilyn's date: May 21, 1999. (10 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>Stories of people trying to do good: Why they often fail and why they occasionally succeed.

Prologue
When Brigid starting going blind, she tried to hire someone to drive her around. Only problem was, the guy she hired wanted to carry her groceries, hold her arm as she walked to the curb...he tried to help her in too many ways. When we try to help others we tend to think it's a simple thing, when in fact it's as complicated as any human relationship, which is why it's so easy to blunder. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Jackie and Kenny Wharton were kids in the tiny town of Canalou, Missouri, off of old Highway 61. They moved away for 40 years but always dreamed of moving back. After Kenny retired, they finally did. Canalou had fallen on hard times. They hoped to do a few things to help restore some of the spirit it had when they were kids: Modest, innocent things, maybe start a softball league, build a place for kids to play ball, maybe pave a few streets. And the more they tried, the more people resented them. After three years, they realized that something had changed in Canalou that would take a lot more than two do-gooders could fix. This is the story of what went wrong. (33 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Modern-day fables of two different kinds of do-gooders during and after the 1994 genocide in the African country of Rwanda. Philip Gourevich, author of the book We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will be Killed With Our Families: Stories from Rwanda , tells first about international relief workers who served as "caterers" to some of the Hutu powers as they continued their policy of ethnic cleansing after fleeing to refugee camps. Then he tells the story of a more effective do-gooder: A hotel owner in Kigali who saved hundreds of lives by keeping a fully stocked bar that Hutu officials liked to frequent, by bribing officials, and by using the international phone lines. In Gourevich's description, he's a lot like Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca, self effacing, friendly with evildoers, and very effective. (18 minutes) _Ira Glass, Philip Gourevitch_

      <description>This entire show is devoted to just one story. A former pimp tells how he and three childhood friends became pimps in the 1970s in Oakland, California. He explains all the elaborate "rules of the game" among pimps and prostitutes of that era. He didn't have the stomach for the violence of pimping, and failed as a pimp because of that. Tamar Brott reports.

Prologue
Ira talks about the classic biography of an American pimp, Iceberg Slim's Pimp: The Story of My Life , and explains today's show. He warns listeners that although there's no sex in the show at all, there is a scene or two in which men hit women. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
How Kevin and his friends got into the game of pimping, and the rules of the game at the time. (30 minutes) _Tamar Brott_

Act Two
Kevin's story continues. We hear about his own rise and fall as a pimp, and how he failed in his attempt to be a different kind of pimp—a less cruel kind. (22 minutes) _Tamar Brott_

      <description>There's a tourist monument called Four Corners, where Arizona, Colorado, Utah and New Mexico meet. In this episode, we try to tell the story of life in America through portraits of life on four different corners, in four different states across the nation.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks about the Four Corners tourist monument where Arizona, Colorado, Utah and New Mexico meet. He proposes creating our own little monument to America: a four corners show depicting life on four street corners across this great nation. (2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Sarah Vowell has a theory that you can tell the entire history of the United States by standing on one street corner—specifically at Michigan Avenue and Wacker Drive in Chicago—and describing all the events that happened within eyeshot of the corner. She covers three centuries of history, from Louis Joliet to Keanu Reeves. Correction: In this story Sarah Vowell references The Jungle and mistakenly cites the author as Sinclair Lewis. The correct author is Upton Sinclair. (21 minutes) _Sarah Vowell_

Act Two
Scott Richer and Julie Riggs of Louisville, Kentucky, were supposed to have their first kiss at the corner where South Fourth Street meets the alley behind the West End Baptist Church. But it went wrong. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
Writer Mike Paterniti tells a story of dogs and a community of dogwalkers that formed on the grounds of an old cemetery at the corner of Vaughn and Clifford in Portland, Maine. (14 minutes) _Mike Paterniti_

Act Four
Writer Achy Obejas reads a piece of short fiction from her book, We Came All the Way from Cuba So You Could Dress Like This? (11 minutes) _Achy Obejas_

      <description>A program taped before live audiences in Seattle (thanks to public radio station KUOW) and at HBO's U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen. A taxonomy of different kinds of advice—and stories that illustrate why advice is so rarely taken.

Prologue
When Adam and Jamie were kids, Jamie would always ask for Adam's advice, but he didn't want to hear what Adam would say himself. Instead, he wanted Adam to pretend to be an Israeli commando he once knew, named Yakov. Yakov seemed to know things that Adam didn't. But still Jamie wouldn't take the advice. Which raises the question: What would it take? When we give advice, we witness the the puniness of reason when compared with the vastness of human inertia and emotion. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
What if you asked people for advice and actually took all the advice that everyone gave you? As an experiment, writer Sarah Vowell tried exactly that, when she recently solicited advice from many different people about insomnia. (15 minutes) _Sarah Vowell_

Act Two
Host Ira Glass talks with his mom—a clinical psychologist—about why people seem to rarely take the advice others give. Then advice columnist Dan Savage, author of the syndicated column and book Savage Love , gives the audience some advice that hopefully might save lives. (24 minutes) _Ira Glass, Dan Savage_

Act Three
Forget all the self-help seminars you've ever heard of or attended. Writer Cheryl Trykv leads the audience in Seattle in a guided meditation, to end our program with epiphany, epiphany, epiphany. (10 minutes) _Cheryl Trykv_

      <description>Stories of people going home to places they've never been before.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass with Eddy Harris. The first time Eddie set foot in a black nation in Africa, a man at the border found out he was an American—a black American—and said "Welcome home." But Eddy Harris says the Motherland doesn't really feel much like home. He describes his year-long trip through Africa, and how it all came to a head on a river trip in Zaire. He recounts the trip in his book Native Stranger: A Black American's Journey into the Heart of Africa. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Twenty-six-year-old Jose William Huezo Soriano—a.k.a. Weasel—grew up in Los Angeles. Under new sentencing laws, he got deported to his parents' home country of El Salvador, a country he has not seen since he was five years old. He has no memories of the country, no immediate family there, and people have a hard time understanding his Spanish. He records an audio diary of his life in exile for radio producer Joe Richman, part of Joe's Radio Diaries series. (26 minutes) _Joe Richman_

Act Two
In this act we hear two stories of people who stumbled upon a place where they instantly and instinctively felt more at home than in their real homes. Stephen Dubner, author of the memoir Turbulent Souls: A Catholic Son's Return to His Jewish Family , talks about an encounter with a Jewish man named Irving that changed his life. Then Hungarian radio producer Anna Lengyl has an interview with two people who simply decided that they had more in common with each other than either had with anyone else. Finding a home where you've never been—it's a lot like falling in love. (23 minutes) _Stephen Dubner, Ira Glass, Anna Lengyl_

      <description>Stories in which young people take matters into their own hands: Students who become political activists, students who pull pranks, violent students. Broadcast for the tenth anniversary of the crackdown at Tiananmen Square.

Prologue
On the tenth anniversary of the crackdown at Tiananmen Square, we hear from Wen Huang, who was part of the student movement. He says that the students weren't fighting for democracy, at least not as it's been widely understood in the West. He—and other former student activists from China—say the protests were an expression of sheer pleasure in living, a rock-n-roll bravado, a desire for a better future. But they never wanted to see American-style democracy or the overthrow of the Communist government, or anything so grand. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
More stories from Wen Huang that contradict what you think you know about the 1989 student uprising in China. (9 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
If part of the impulse behind the Tiananmen Square uprising was the pure desire to feel like life had possibility, that the future had potential...that impulse was behind another movement. This one among young people in Eastern Europe back before the Berlin Wall fell. The movement had to do with music: jazz. We hear an excerpt from Josef Skvorecky's essay "Red Music" (collected in his book Talkin' Moscow Blues ), about how jazz in Czechoslovakia during the 1940s and 1950s seemed to pose a threat, first to the Nazi occupation, then to the Communist authorities. The story is read by Broadway actor Ed Dixon. (17 minutes) _Ed Dixon, Josef Skvorecky_

Act Three
Since the high school shootings in Littleton, Colorado, parents and teachers are looking for warning signs that the children in their lives might suddenly strike out. But the dividing line between normal childhood aggression and social pathology can be hard to spot. Writer Paul Bravmann tells a story from his own boyhood in a West coast suburb about the difficulty of spotting that line. (14 minutes)

Act Four
The most innocent possible student uprising imaginable...documented by an actual student, Hillary Frank, using the crude tools of a telephone answering machine and a shiny red boom box. (11 minutes) _Hillary Frank_

      <description>For Father's Day, stories about fathers going out of their way to protect their kids, and kids going out of their way to protect their fathers.

Prologue
The story of the lengths a father will go to to retrieve a lost teddy bear, and why—after he's enlisted many other parents to help him wade through tens of thousands of bags of trash to find it—none of the parents involved think he's nuts. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
The story begun in the Prologue continues. As it continues, it takes on the exact narrative structure of the movie Saving Private Ryan. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Photographer Joel Meyerowitz decided to go on a last big trip with his father Hy, who has Alzheimer's. Joel also brought his own son. The purpose of the trip? To try to get close to a part of Hy's personality that Alzheimer's has eradicated and see if it might be possible to jumpstart some of his memories. Joel and his son decide to make a movie of the trip. We hear some of the very funny, very moving raw footage. The film, Pop, aired on the PBS program Frontline. (24 minutes) _Joel Meyerowitz_

Act Three
What happens when a dad tries too hard to protect his child from disappointment and instead enthrall the child. With the best of intentions, New Yorker writer Lawrence Weschler did all that, and in the process accidentally broke his daughter's heart. And then she took action and mended the problem. This story was first broadcast a year ago on Father's Day, when his daughter Sara was 11. (20 minutes) _Lawrence Weschler_

      <description>Consider for a moment all the art forms that began in America: jazz, the blues, musical theater, rock n' roll, phonograph recordings, television, motion pictures, video games. But the art form in which America leads the world—more than any other—is the art of selling. In this show: case examples to prove the point.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass lays out the premise of this week's show. (2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
A story that takes place at the crossroads where art meets commerce—a place where we can ask the question: Is the art of commerce better than the art of art? Writer (and occasional screenwriter) Sandra Tsing Loh accompanies a Hollywood screenwriter as he tries to sell a movie idea—a comedy in the style of Liar Liar. (19 minutes) _Sandra Loh_

Act Two
Writer/performer Danny Hoch performs a monologue taken from his one man show, Jails, Hospitals and Hip-Hop. It's a story about a guy who's been locked up for doing the most American activity possible: Selling stuff on the street (in this case Bart Simpson/O.J. Simpson t-shirts). His show is available on CD from his website. (5 minutes) _Danny Hoch_

Act Three
Becoming a salesman can make you more confident and happy, make you ignore it when someone tells you "no"...and why that might be a bad thing. The story of a man who sold radio advertising. (11 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Four
What happens to you if you stay in sales all your life? 76-year-old salesman "Diamond" Jimmy Roy has sold everything from used cars to antiques to jewelery. Independent producer Dan Collison shadowed Jimmy Roy in his native Braddock, Pennsylvania, to talk to him about the philosophy that's kept him going as a salesman for over fifty years. (18 minutes) _Dan Collison_

      <description>Stories about what happens when we don't do something. It turns out that not falling in love, not doing our jobs, not spending time with our families is every bit as vivid and complicated an experience as doing something.

Prologue
Ira reads a very brief excerpt from a short story from writer Stuart Dybek called "We Didn't." Dybek fills 11 pages, thousands of words, describing all the things two people do when they're not doing something. "We Didn't" appears in The Best American Short Stories: 1994. (3 minutes) _Stuart Dybek, Ira Glass_

Act One
This story is part memoir, part philosophical inquiry into the nature of not doing things. Writer Geoff Dyer had always wanted to write a biography about D.H. Lawrence, and chronicles all the things that keep him from ever starting. This, he says, is how most of us lead our lives: Avoiding the things we think we should be doing. This is an excerpt from his book called Out of Sheer Rage: Wrestling with D.H. Lawrence. (16 minutes) _Geoff Dyer_

Act Two
What do we do when we're not doing something? Not writing a book, not doing our jobs, not falling in love? Sometimes we just feel self-conscious. Sometimes we spend a lot of time explaining ourselves. Sometimes both. Danny Hoch demonstrates, in this monologue from his one-person show Jails, Hospitals and Hip Hop . His show is available on CD from his website . (8 minutes) _Danny Hoch_

Act Three
Writer/Comedian Amanda Marks shares the story of a couple that didn't fall in love, didn't get together, didn't form a future. Then coincidence and fate kick in...confusingly. (10 minutes) _Amanda Marks_

Act Four
Journalist Steve Bogira tells the story of Vincent Bogan, who said "no" to something once—a decade ago, when he was 21—and now has to live with that one decisive act. Bogan was arrested and charged with 17 counts of armed robbery. He was offered a 25-year sentence if he pled guilty to all 17 counts. But he refused this plea-bargain arrangement. He ended up losing four cases, sentenced to 75 years in prison. Partly this is a story about what he says about that one decision he made a decade ago to refuse the plea bargain. Partly it's about how the courts punish people who decide to go to trial—tying up the courts—with sentences of extra severity. (19 minutes)

      <description>We think of crime as a kind of monolithic, menacing presence. But there are many kinds of crimes and many kinds of criminals. Through our crimes, we express who we are. Today we hear of three different criminals and three different kinds of crimes.

Prologue
A survey of local crime blotters from the Anacortes American (by John Bauer; thanks also to Gail Mann and Duncan Frazier) in Anacortes, Washington; the Pueblo Chieftain (by Juan Espinosa) in Pueblo, Colorado; and the Athens Daily News (by Ben Deck, Stephen Gurr and Joan Stroer; thanks also to Jim Thompson and Greg Martin) in Athens, Georgia. Actor Matt Malloy reads. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass, Matt Malloy_

Act One
When she was 21, Julia Sweeney got a job as a bartender's assistant and stole between ten and fifteen thousand dollars in cash. She describes the thrill of stealing, and how she justified her thefts to herself, and—oddest of all—how she became a more religious Roman Catholic during her crime spree. Julia Sweeney's an actress and writer, a former cast member at Saturday Night Live; and star of her autobiographical movie God Said Ha! . (14 minutes) _Julia Sweeney_

Act Two
Some criminals do not see themselves as basically good people getting away with something bad. Some people do not believe God is on their side when they commit their crimes. We have this story from reporter Marilyn Snell about a bankrobber who now lives in Oakland, California. Crime Blotter Redux. We hear more crime blotter readings from around the nation, read by actor Matt Malloy. (17 minutes) _Marilyn Snell_

Act Three
No one knows how much theft is committed each year by senior citizens. One study found that seniors comprise 15 percent of people apprehended for shoplifting. Seniors of course, tend to be poorer than other Americans, but counselors who work with senior shoplifters say that many of them aren't stealing out of need. About half of senior shoplifters have stolen all their lives. Documentary filmmaker Jeanne C. Finley talks with an elderly shoplifter to find out why. (15 minutes) _Jeanne Finley_

      <description>Three stories, three people, and three sets of maps. Stories of people trying to figure out where they are in the world in the most literal and least literal ways possible. We explore what it's like to be lost—how we all struggle in that moment not to give ourselves over to fear but try to enjoy it.

Prologue
Amy McGuiness flies tourists to the North Pole who pay thousands of dollars for the privilege. When you get to the Pole, it looks exactly like all the other ice you've been staring at for hours. The tourists climb out of the plane and they take pictures. In addition, most people now spend time looking at Global Positioning Devices, which tell them, yes, this is in fact the North Pole. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
John Bowe decided to visit a friend of his who was in the peace corp in Mali, in West Africa. But he chose the most difficult possible route to get there. He decided to hitchhike across the Sahara desert using a 1,000-mile-long remote route that most hitchhikers avoid. He purchased no special gear and carried a small bag filled mostly with books, a change of clothes and one Michelin map. But the map was used to literally get him off the grid. (19 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
It can be frightening to get lost, but what if you could adapt the thrill of being lost, the pleasure of being lost, to safe parameters? Just get a little lost. Is it even possible? Or is that playing with fire, where you're sure to get burned? Writer David Sedaris has these thoughts.. (14 minutes) _David Sedaris_

Act Three
Nicole Graev, an assistant to the editor at a publishing house, needs to know if her job as an assistant is actually an educational career step or a waste of time. The things she's been doing as an assistant—answering phones, faxing—is entirely different than the skills she needs for the job she really wants: her boss's. She talks to several people who've held the job before her to see if they can help her figure out where she is on the map of her life. (16 minutes) _Nicole Graev_

      <description>Stories of people who believe a book changed their life. It's a romantic notion, and one reason we believe it is because we want to believe our lives can be changed by something so simple as an idea — or a set of ideas contained in a book.

Prologue
When Alexa was seven, she started going through her grandfather's books. Her grandfather was a playwright and teacher, and through the books—and especially through his notes in the margins—she entered the world of 1930's American theater. And she found a book that changed her life: writer Moss Hart's autobiography Act One . (5 minutes) _Ira Glass, Alexa Junge_

Act One
More of Alexa Junge and how Moss Hart's autobiography changed her life. She followed his path, learned specific lessons, and had a vision of him that was absolutely clear—until she met his widow. (10 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
The story of a book that changed a family's life, but only temporarily and not for the better. David Sedaris describes what happens when he finds a dirty book in the woods and shares it with his sisters. This story is published in Sedaris' book Naked. (9 minutes) _David Sedaris_

Act Three
Reporter Jeremy Goldstein tells the story of a man who had many books change his life, even though he'd never read them. Available: The Journals of Lewis and Clark, containing excerpts from the explorers' journals. (14 minutes) _Jeremy Goldstein_

Act Four
Writer Meghan Daum goes to DeSmet, South Dakota, where Laura Ingalls Wilder lived and where many of the books she wrote in the Little House on the Prairie series are set. It turns out to be remarkably similar to what Meghan had pictured before she went: The people seem like they are genuinely trying to hold on to the values Laura Ingalls Wilder writes about in her books. Two of the Little House books set in DeSmet are By the Shores of Silver Lake , and Little Town on the Prairie . (15 minutes) _Meghan Daum_

      <description>Stories of people drawn to some idea, some picture, some "thing" that they just want to be. How some people imitate this "thing" innocently, some less innocently, and how easy it is to slip from one to the other.

Prologue
The story of Jug Burkett, a businessman in Dallas and a Vietnam vet, who years ago routinely started checking the bona fides of anyone in the news who claimed to have served in the Vietnam war. He says he's found hundreds of fakers, and he says that one of the tricky things about the fakers is that they often seem more like The Real Thing than real vets do. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
The story of someone trying and trying to get close to The Real Thing, and why it was so difficult. Kelly McEvers was a newspaper writer here in Chicago and started to get interested in stories she was hearing about girl gang members. So she got an assignment and tried to get to know them. She found herself changing the way she dressed, changing the way she talked, changing herself to become more like a real gang girl. (13 minutes)

Act Two
Professor Glenn Loury from Boston University and John Simpkins on basketball, hockey, and what makes a real black person. (10 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
What does it mean to talk like a real Southerner—and why a multimillion industry can't seem to figure it out. Southern expatriate Mark Schone dissects Southern accents as they're portrayed in movies and TV shows. (15 minutes) _Mark Schone_

Act Four
There's The Real Thing when it comes to your idea of what job you want, what house you want, what person you want to fall in love with. And until you find The Real Thing you seek, life is the same story over and over again: It's the story of not getting The Real Thing yet again. Los Angeles writer and performer Sandra Tsing Loh tells what happened to her when she found the perfect man via a computer dating service. (12 minutes)

      <description>Stories of political idealists, stories designed to provide some small sense of hope about American politics. Most of these were first broadcast during the 1996 Presidential race.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass with an idealistic would-be politician in California. The puzzle of American politics is that our political system is filled with idealistic people, but few of our candidates for top office seem either idealistic or capable of inspiring passion. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
A campaign diary from writer Michael Lewis from four years ago, about a politician you've heard a lot about: John McCain...and the story of a moment when the opposite of normal politics became normal politics. Lewis's campaign diaries are collected in his book Trail Fever: Spin Doctors, Rented Strangers, and Thumb Wrestlers on the Road to the White House. (15 minutes) _Michael Lewis_

Act Two
A Walter Mondale-voting, gay-rights-supporting unrepentant liberal signs up as a Republican party member—and ends up a party functionary—a delegate to the state Republican convention...where he wreaks havoc. Dan Savage tells the story. (16 minutes) _Dan Savage_

Act Three
How California Governor Pete Wilson's anti-immigrant policies found some supporters among immigrants themselves. We hear an explanation of the profoundly idealistic notion of "self-deportation" from its main proponent, Daniel D. Portado. (6 minutes) _Daniel Portado_

Act Four
A few years back Alex Kotlowitz wrote a book called There Are No Children Here , about two boys growing up in Chicago's Henry Horner public housing projects. Those projects were across the street from the site of the 1996 Democratic Convention in Chicago, and when the convention came to town, money poured in for a makeover. One of the kids from the book, Pharoah Walton—now grown up—gave a tour, showing us what got fixed up, and how the real improvements in the neighborhood all happened underneath the normal political radar. (10 minutes)

Host Ira Glass with Rory Evans, who describes the day her father fired his own mother from their family business, a machine shop called Evans Industries. Some estimates say that 40 to 60 percent of our nation's gross domestic product is created by family businesses, but talking to anyone who works for one of these companies, you end up wondering...how? (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
David Rakoff takes us inside the world of a Greek family-owned ice cream parlour, and what he learned about the husband and wife and son who owned it...and what he didn't figure out until later. (12 minutes) _David Rakoff_

Act Two
Sean Cole visits Chad's Trading Post in Southampton, Massachussetts. One person who works there wears a shirt that says "Chad's Brother;" other shirts say "Chad's Best Friend," "Chad's Cousin," "Chad's Father." Pictures of Chad are everywhere. Chad's dead. The family explains. (14 minutes) _Sean Cole_

Act Three
Dave Eggers on what happens when politics suddenly becomes your family business. When his brother ran for office, he asked for Dave's help and support. But his brother's political views were in contrast to Dave's own. He explains what he did. (12 minutes) _Dave Eggers_

Act Four
Hillary Frank explains how an invitation to a business meeting, sent through the mail in 1963, kept two sides of a family from speaking to each other for most of the second half of the 20th Century. (10 minutes) _Hillary Frank_

      <description>Stories of people who are trying to make invisible worlds visible, and what happens when you make them visible.

Prologue
There are thousands of voices passing through your body right now on radio waves—signals from cellular phones and cordless phones, military transmissions and baby monitors. You're not supposed to listen in on these. Someone explains why he does anyway. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Producer Alex Blumberg with people who listen in on the invisible world on the nether reaches of the radio spectrum, mostly illegally...and what they find there. (14 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

Act Two
One of the most powerful forces in a room can be the thing that is unspoken between people. Five writers—Scott Carrier, David Sedaris, Sarah Vowell, Brady Udall and Lan Samantha Chang—give us case examples: stories when they felt the presence of something unspoken. (16 minutes) _Scott Carrier, Lan Samantha Chang, David Sedaris, Brady Udall, Sarah Vowell_

Act Three
The publisher of the zine Infiltration talks about the pleasure and importance of going behind the scenes of everyday life. (11 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Four
Producer Nancy Updike tells the story of scientists who simply made up an invisible, weightless subatomic particle called the neutrino. Then they set out on the task of finding it, using tools that sound positively crude: A mineshaft and 100,000 gallons of dry cleaning fluid. (9 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

      <description>We hear the story of one African-American single mother. Barbara Clinkscales recorded her family's life over the course of seven months forThis American Life.Her life defies—or makes irrelevant—most of our typical notions of inner-city, black single mothers.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass describes the moment when black single mothers became a national political issue—and a national symbol. It was 1965, when a young Assistant Secretary of Labor named Daniel Patrick Moynihan issued a report calling for action on the issue of African-American single mothers, and black leaders, including the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., opposed him. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Barbara Clinkscales grew up in Chicago's public housing projects, had her first child when she was 15, and is now—over two decades later—struggling to get her teenage son to finish his senior year of high school. Barbara is a working mom, with a network of close friends who look out for her. She is so fiercely insistent that her son graduate high school that she personally takes him to his first class every day. This remarkable look at daily life on Chicago's south side was assembled from Barbara's tapes by producer Alix Spiegel with funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. (33 minutes) _Alix Spiegel_

Act Two
Barbara's story continues, as she hears some terrible news about her son. (18 minutes) _Alix Spiegel_

      <description>We've all heard occasional news stories about how some of the drug laws enacted in the last 15 years may have gone too far. First time offenders get locked up for decades. Judges—even Republican appointees—say that mandatory minimum sentences prevent them from making fair rulings. But have sentences really gone too far? This hour examines the areas where a consensus is growing on the problems in federal drug laws, and it explains the areas where drug laws seem to be administered fairly.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass with former Congressman Daniel Rostenkowski. When Rostenkowski began a term in federal prison, he met for the first time people who'd been locked up under harsh drug laws that he'd voted for himself. "The whole thing's a sham," he declares. He confesses that he didn't really understand the mandatory minimum sentences he voted for in the 1980s; he just followed the lead of colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, which drafted the laws. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
The story of how a person could be sentenced to 19 years for drug possession—even if police found no drugs, drug money, residue or paraphrenalia—even if it's a first offense. Dorothy Gaines was an Alabama nurse with no prior record and no physical evidence of any drugs who was sentenced to 19 years. The only evidence against her was the testimony of admitted drug dealers who received reduced sentences in exchange for naming co-conspirators. (14 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
We hear the history of why these drug laws were enacted from a firsthand witness. Eric Sterling was the lawyer in charge of drug laws for the House Judiciary Committee during the 1980s, when mandatory minimums were put in place. He tells the inside story of how the laws were rammed through Congress—with no input from judges, prison wardens or police officers—as part of a frenzy of get-tough posturing led not by Republicans, but by Democrats. (15 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
Judges give their opinions of the drug sentencing laws. Terry Hatter is the Chief U.S. District Judge for the Central District of California. He says that under the current federal guidelines, 20 percent of the time he can't give the sentence he thinks will be fair. Judge Morris Lasker, of the Southern District of New York, a veteran of over 30 years on the bench, stopped hearing drug cases for several years. Eighty-six percent of federal judges believe the current guidelines need to be loosened. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Four
Before this show ended we wanted to know—how typical are the horror stories? What happens in a typical drug case? To find out, reporter Nancy Updike spent nine hours in Night Narcotics Court in Chicago. What she discovers is that the system is working as fairly as one could hope or expect, with one caveat: Nearly all the defendants are African-American, even though the jurisdiction contains an equal number of white drug users. (15 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

      <description>One reason we tell stories is to explain things to ourselves that cannot, in the end, always be explained. When someone we're close to dies, we struggle for a way to get our minds around the fact of their absence. And often—the stories we invent aren't quite up to the job. In this week's show, people struggle to invent words adequate to cope with death.

Prologue
Reporter Mark Arax spent three years investigating the murder of his father and yet he's still not at peace when he thinks of his dad's death. (His book is called In My Father's Name: A Family, a Town, a Murder. ) This is how it goes sometimes. We create a story that tries to explain our lives, and it still leaves so much unanswered. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Genevieve Jurgensen and her husband Laurent lost their two daughters, Elise and Mathilde, at the ages of 4 and 7. Actress Felicity Jones reads from Jurgensen's book, The Disappearance: A Memoir of Loss , in which Jurgensen tries to explain her children's lives and their deaths to a friend through a series of letters. (29 minutes) _Felicity Jones, Genevieve Jurgensen_

Act Two
A father and daughter (Adrian LeBlank and his daughter Adrian Le Blank) decide to write his obituary—together—not really thinking very seriously at first about the real meaning of what they were doing. (11 minutes) _Adrian Nicole LeBlanc_

Act Three
Some of us have tragedy thrust upon us. Some of us allow ourselves a few moments to contemplate the worst that could happen. And some of us choose to think about the worst that can befall our families all the time. But is that good for you? Julie Snyder discusses this with her brother Tom, who plans obsessively for the deaths of each member of their family. (10 minutes) _Julie Snyder_

      <description>For Thanksgiving, the time of year when poultry consumption is highest, it's our annual program about turkeys, chickens, fowl of all types, and their mysterious hold over our imaginations. This show includes favorite stories from previous Poultry Shows, and some new stories.

Prologue
Ira Glass introduces this episode about... fish?

Act One
The story of a typical American family—imaginary poultry—and a handpuppet. (17 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
What happens when a chicken crosses the thin yellow line that divides the animals we eat from the animals we keep as pets. Jonathan Gold, food writer for Gourmet magazine, tells how he accidentally came to adopt a chicken, and what happened to his opinion of chickens afterwards. (14 minutes) _Jonathan Gold_

Act Three
The true story of how a multinational chicken company turned a white man into a black man. The man they did it to? An old time Kentucky Colonel who liked to dress up as a Southern plantation owner in string tie and goatee, who happened to be their own spokesman. Mark Schone reports. (13 minutes) _Mark Schone_

Act Four
Yet another testimony to the power chickens have over our hearts and minds. Jack Hitt reports on an opera about Chicken Little. It's performed with dressed-up styrofoam balls, it's sung in Italian, and it's—no kidding—able to make grown men cry. CDs of the opera Love's Fowl by Susan Vitucci and Henry Krieger are available at pulcina.org. (13 minutes) _Jack Hitt_

      <description>Stories of nature creeping into man-made environments. Of nature sneaking in places where its very presence is a rebuke to the notion that we as a species have things under control.

Prologue
Stories about rats in the city, from Kate Aurthur (former rat columnist for New York magazine), and from a Mark Lewis documentary called Rat . When rats arrive in our homes, we remember why we as a species wanted to tame nature in the first place. It feels like a contest of man versus nature in which nature actually has a fighting chance. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Building everything that comprises modern life—constructing cities and suburbs both—means trampling nature. And that bothers some people. They want to keep nature at hand, even in the city. David Rakoff visited Reykjavik, Iceland, where the government is careful not to disturb certain boulders when it builds roads because some people believe that invisible "hidden people"—like elves—live at those sites. (17 minutes) _David Rakoff_

Act Two
Unlike Reykjavik, some cities don't coddle citizens in their idiosyncratic beliefs about nature. We hear New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani react (with vehemence) to a man who believes New Yorkers should have the right to keep ferrets in their homes. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
Scott Carrier tells the story of trying to bring a part of the outside world inside the house when he was a boy. His brother wanted to capture a rattlesnake and bring it home and keep in the basement, as a secret. It didn't work out as they planned. (10 minutes) _Scott Carrier_

Act Four
True stories of what happens when children are allowed to bring nature's own creatures into the house as pets. When it comes to rodents, fish and amphibians, it often works out badly...for the pets. We hear especially from one Chicago high-school freshman, who spoke with producer Starlee Kine. If you're looking for "bite toad," this is it. (5 minutes) _Starlee Kine_

Act Five
We end our show with a story of city life and the natural world co-existing peacefully. Iggy Scam went on a mission seeking urban fisherman—guys who throw down fishing poles right down in the middle of the big city, often in the most polluted industrial environments possible. (11 minutes) _Iggy Scam_

      <description>It's an odd fact of religious life in America that in this country founded by Christians, in which a majority of people say they believe in God and identify themselves as Christians, that so many religious Christians feel they're an oppressed minority. They say the media doesn't share their values. That secular institutions undermine their beliefs. And the job of raising Christian children, they'll tell you, is like trying to do God's work from behind enemy lines. This week we're devoting our whole show to the kids they're struggling to bring up.

Prologue
This American Life host Ira Glass and producer Susan Burton spent a week in August recording a suburban Chicago youth group at every stage of their very first mission trip. The teenagers were from Covenant Presbyterian Church in Chicago. They went to West Virginia, to fix up someone's house, and to witness about their faith to strangers. The goal: That they mature from a child's kind of faith to an adult's. There's a boom in mission trips like this right now, a boom that crosses denominations.

Act One
These teenagers are the children the Christian right has in mind when it holds conferences on what's at stake in America's culture war. On the fourteen-hour drive to West Virginia, we listen to the Backstreet Boys and talk about Dawson's Creek. One of the things that's so interesting about these teenagers is the odd mix of Christian and secular pop in their lives. (13 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
The teenagers arrive in West Virginia and take a look around. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
Hardships begin. Their leader gets sick. One of their projects fails. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Four
One great thing about staying in a camp of 130 other Christians is the much-better-than-in-school chance of meeting a nice, cute Christian boy. (8 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Five
The teenagers try to get to know the locals, without a lot of success. (9 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Six
Some improvements in their missionary work. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Seven
The limits of what one accomplishes on a mission trip like this. (10 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>A special Christmas edition of our show, with stories about Santa Claus—me It was in America, in New York, that people started believing in the modern idea of Santa—a guy who comes down the chimney with a sack of goodies. But America has invented a few other Santas as well.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with Stephen Nissenbaum, author of a history called The Battle for Christmas , which explains when people started believing in a Santa who arrives Christmas Eve carrying presents. It was in 1822, and incredibly, the poem that created our modern idea of Santa is still around, known by heart by tens of millions. (8 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
We begin our show with the most idealistic notion of Santa. Mike Paterniti heads on a quest across the country, looking for something we've lost, when it comes to Santa. (18 minutes) _Mike Paterniti_

Act Two
Sarah Vowell explains why so many popular songs portray Santa as a ladies man. (8 minutes) _Sarah Vowell_

Act Three
Riz Rollins tells a story about himself, his brother, his grandmother and a guy in a Chicago department store they hope has some pull with Santa. (8 minutes) _Riz Rollins_

Act Four
What if do-gooders patrolled department stores, keeping tabs on the Santas? We hear this story, of The Most Fantastic Crimefighter The World Has Ever Known: Chickenman. Recorded for This American Life by Dick Orkin, Christine Coyle and Rod Roddy at the Radio Ranch in Los Angeles. All the various voices are played by Orkin and Coyle—with Roddy announcing. (4 minutes) _Christine Coyle, Dick Orkin_

Act Five
Students in a French language class in Paris try to explain holiday customs to a woman from Morocco, and somehow everything they describe sounds utterly improbable. A true story from writer David Sedaris, recorded before a live audience at a reading for City Arts and Lectures in San Francisco. (10 minutes) _David Sedaris_

      <description>In the hospital, we give up our normal schedule and sleep patterns; we give up our normal food and clothing; we're in a place that has its own rules and its own language and its own customs. And in the midst of all this, there's this complicated human interaction we have to negotiate: We have to deal with doctors and nurses to get the care we need. In this show we hear stories of those delicate and sometimes not-so-delicate negotiations.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with Robert Lipsyte, author of In the Country of Illness , who tells a story of how one lady in New York won the hospital staff over to her side with one conversation. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
When Terry Shine's father was in the hospital, Terry and his brothers spent weeks trying to do whatever they could to help. But first they had to learn the language and customs of the average American hospital. For example, consider this question: Would their dad get better medical care if they dressed in cleanly pressed shirts and ties? This is an excerpt from Terry Shine's book Fathers Aren't Supposed to Die: Five Brothers Reunite to Say Goodbye . (15 minutes) _Terry Shine_

Act Two
No radio program about caregivers in a hospital would be complete without a few words about the caregiver that is the most omnipresent...in every room, in the waiting rooms, at the nurses' stations. It's television. To investigate its power in a medical facility, Nancy Updike went to the most television-friendly hospital imaginable: The one actual television stars go to when they get sick, Cedar Sinai in Los Angeles. (6 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Three
When a nurse asks a 14-year-old burn victim out for ice cream, is it a date? Brent Runyon tells the story, which was produced by Jay Allison , part of his Life Stories series, with help from Christina Egloff and funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The story is part of Runyon's book The Burn Journals. Ira then speaks with an interested party. (19 minutes) _Jay Allison, Brent Runyon_

Act Four
Wendy Dorr, an assistant producer at Radio Diaries , has this story of what happens to you if you break one of the cardinal rules of a hospital, over and over, for years. (8 minutes) _Wendy Dorr_

      <description>Stories of kids trying to act like adults—some by choice—some because they're forced to.

Prologue
The story of a teenagers' party among teenagers who thought of themselves as very grownup. In many ways they completely understand what a grownup party is like: Quiet conversation with lots of thoughtful nodding of heads, alcohol without excessive or loud consumption. Except there's one custom of an adult party they get completely wrong. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Mike Paterniti talks about working on a teen ambulance corps, growing up in Connecticut. (19 minutes) _Mike Paterniti_

Act Two
When Anh Tuan Hoang was 12 and living in Vietnam back in 1980, his cousin was scheming up a way to escape the country by boat. Anh Tuan was invited too. He wanted to go, but for reasons that had very little to do with reality and everything to do with the way a kid sees the world. (12 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
This is another story of a young person making a huge, life-changing decision about his own fate while still very young. Hillary Frank tells the story, about her own little brother—and his trumpet. (11 minutes) _Hillary Frank_

Act Four
This is the story of two people—one in his late teens, one in his late fifties. Both have good reasons to be mad at the world, but what they did with their anger—and what society did with them—are very different. Willie Ross ended up as an assistant superintendent at a juvenile detention center; Terence Golden ended up imprisoned there. (10 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>Today's program is made all of stories from the New Hampshire primary. Voters want to find a candidate who inspires them. Candidates want to inspire. So where's the system failing? Why do most of us feel like the system doesn't produce anyone inspiring? We hear stories that answer why. We hear from voters who've found candidates they love. And we hear what those voters are seeing that the rest of us aren't.

Prologue
Three days into the beginning of the new millenium, Kahari Mosley and Garcia Suzinko left home to do something they'd never done before: They took a twelve-hour bus ride to New Hampshire to volunteer for a Presidential campaign. What they saw...and what moved them to volunteer in the first place. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Here in America, here's how we interact with our political candidates: We dispatch middlemen to the scene, they listen to what the candidates say, they research the candidates' backgrounds, and they tell us what they think is most important. Those middlemen, of course, are journalists. Sarah Vowell tells a fable about the difference between the way the middlemen see the world and the way non-journalists see it. (23 minutes) _Sarah Vowell_

Act Two
Usually it's difficult to get to know the front-runner in a Presidential race. With the most to lose, front-runners are the least spontaneous candidates. They stay on message. In debates, George W. Bush often gives the same few answers to all sorts of different questions. Sarah Koenig has been covering the Bush campaign for months for the Concord Monitor , a New Hampshire newspaper. She tells a story of trying to get to know the "real" George W. Bush. (14 minutes) _Sarah Koenig_

Act Three
Alex Blumberg tells the story of citizens who feel perfectly connected to their candidate of choice. Citizens who feel inspired by him. Some will even say he's as inspiring as "pulling a misty flip." (11 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

      <description>Stories of love in its earliest stage. Crushes: what's terrible about them, what's great about them and how they can overshadow real love for some people.

Prologue
A high school student explains the intricacies of a four-year crush, and declares that having a crush can be better than having a boyfriend. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
So what if you held onto a high-school crush? Under what conditions would it never go away? Tobias Wolff reads a short story called "Kiss." (38 minutes) _Tobias Wolff_

Act Two
Bill Bradley press secretary Julia Rothwax explains how a political crush works. This is a crush that wants only for a candidate to get elected to office. She says her own political feelings for Bill Bradley are very different from the way she felt about the only other Presidential candidate she worked for: Bill Clinton. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
As pure of a depiction of unadulterated crush feeling as can be imagined—from writer Haruki Murakami's collection of short stories, The Elephant Vanishes . It's read for us by actor Matt Malloy. (9 minutes) _Matt Malloy, Haruki Murakami_

      <description>Stories of what people are playing at when they play with dolls.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks about the human urge to turn something inanimate into something that's alive, about the moment Pinocchio stops being a concoction of wood and string and becomes a real boy.

Susan Burton reports that it's as if they've settled into a perch inside little girl's dreams and are selling from there. (14 minutes) _Susan Burton_

Act Two
A truly remarkable children's book just came back in print: The Lonely Doll , by Dare Wright. Jean Nathan tells the story of the book and its author, and how the author's life came to resemble something from her book. (20 minutes) _Jean Nathan_

Act Three
Kindergarten teacher and "Genius Grant" recipient Vivian Paley is the author of many books about the stories children invent and the way they play, and what it's about.

      <description>UsuallyThis American Lifebrings you stories of people in themiddleof big experiences. But sometimes these moments of dramatic change are only half the story. The other half occurs after time passes and they return to revisit what happened, and who they were back when. Today's show is about what they find.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with people who've been hit by lightning. They describe what happened at the moment the bolt struck ... and how they came to view it later. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
David Rakoff goes in search of the only existing mementos of a year-and-a-half of his life when he nearly died from Hodgkins Disease. The missing relics are his own pre-chemotherapized sperm — which reside somewhere in a Toronto lab. But over the years, his hospital has moved, the lab has moved, and he has moved. (22 minutes) _David Rakoff_

Act Two
Keith Gessen, a young Russian emigre, revisits the heroes of his youth: the brave Soviet dissidents who risked their lives at the height of the Cold War.

(18 minutes) _Keith Gessen_

Act Three
Producer Julie Snyder looks at what happens in one poor Chicago neighborhood when the community begins to undergo a revitalization and a new store comes to town. (11 minutes) _Julie Snyder_

      <description>All those people you see in the middle of the workday, in coffee shops and bookstores? Who are they? Why aren't they at work?

Prologue
Host Ira Glass stands at the corner of Diversey and Broadway in Chicago and describes all the people who are out at 3:00 on a weekday. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
All those people you see in the middle of the workday, in coffee shops and bookstores? Who are they? Why aren't they at work? Reporter George Gurley tackled these tough questions. On four separate days, he interviewed these loafers in New York. (11 minutes) _George Gurley_

Act Two
At one grain elevator on the outskirts of Lincoln, Nebraska, during the slow months, the five burly men who load corn, soybeans, wheat and milo onto trains spend their work hours watching soap operas. Meghan Daum gets them to explain what they like about the Young and the Restless. (11 minutes)

Act Three
In the early 1970s, a geographer named Roger Hart did a study of exactly where it is that children go during the daytime. For two years, he followed 86 children—all the children in a small town in Vermont, during the hours when parents were away at work. In this rural setting, nearly every child had a secret hiding place somewhere. He explains what the places were, and why nearly every child in town had the compulsion to make a secret place. He published his findings in a book called Children's Experience of Place, which is now out of print. (5 minutes)

Act Four
A postman explains how it is that he can be so much a part of the scenery that people commit crimes in front of him, on quiet daytime streets, as if he's not there. This American Life producer Alex Blumberg spent a day with postman on Chicago's west side, to find out what he sees...and who sees him...and who doesn't see him, even though he's right there. (10 minutes)

Act Five
Writer Mona Simpson reads from her forthcoming novel My Hollywood. This excerpt is about the daytime life of Filipino nannies, during the hours in which they run the lovely homes of certain Los Angeles neighborhoods.

      <description>The pleasure of being in a rampaging, angry mob...and the terror of being in a rampaging, angry mob.

Prologue
There's a TV ad so popular in Canada right now that people chant it in bars, stand and cheer it in theaters and at hockey stadiums. The ad taps into our desire to be part of a mob...and provides a safe way to do it, without fear. Host Ira Glass talks with the vice president for marketing for Molson's beer, which made the ad. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Writer Bill Buford reads from his book Among the Thugs. In it he sets out to try and understand the soccer hooligans who were rioting in ways large and small on a regular basis after soccer matches. It's a remarkable book—in turns funny, and then horrifying. By the time Buford's done, you understand that the thrill of being in a violent mob is as hardwired into us, as basic to us as a species, as the ability to love. (18 minutes) _Bill Buford_

Act Two
What happens when seventh graders become an angry mob? Karen Bernstein reports on her own seventh grade class from small-town Connecticut. In 1973, a teacher turned them into an angry mob, an event they all remember decades later. She tracks down her classmates...and the teacher. (20 minutes) _Karen Bernstein_

Act Three
What happens when a crowd converges over something they strongly believe in, for weeks, and months, in front of television cameras that never go away? To what degree does that change the character of being in a crowd? A few days before Elian Gonzalez was seized by Federal authorities, reporter Alix Spiegel went to the lawn of his home, where activists camped out 24 hours a day. (14 minutes) _Alix Spiegel_

      <description>Stories of moms: How they treat us, how we treat them.

Prologue
Tillie Olsen reads from her short story "I Stand Here Ironing," from her collection Tell Me A Riddle . In the story, a mother reviews all that's gone wrong in the raising of her oldest daughter...and makes a few conclusions about what she should think about her mistakes as a mother. And Host Ira Glass interviews his own mother, who insists—several times—that mothers are always taken for granted. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass, Tillie Olsen_

Act One
Producer Alex Blumberg conducts an investigation, perhaps the first ever, into this American subspecies: People who compulsively imitate their mother's voices in everyday conversation, well into adulthood. (19 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

Act Two
When Jessica Robinson was sent to adult prison at the age of 14, the state did such a terrible job taking care of her that several women—an embezzler, a convicted murderer, and some thieves—stepped in to mother her. Alex Kotlowitz reports. Seven thousand young people like Jessica are now in adult prisons nationwide. (21 minutes) _Alex Kotlowitz_

Act Three
Beau O'Reilly and his mother Winifred, who had 14 children, discuss her secret feelings about Johnny Cash and other matters on Mother's Day. (9 minutes) _Beau O'Reilly_

      <description>In context of the Presidential contest between George W. Bush and Al Gore, we hear stories of character assassination—political and non-political.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with Jack E. Robinson, Republican candidate for Senate in Massachusetts. Within 24 hours of announcing that he was going to collect signatures to get on the ballot to run against Teddy Kennedy, Robinson was attacked in the press. And so he tried a novel tactic: He issued a long public statement that is simply one of the most remarkable documents of current political life in this country. He called it The Robinson Report and posted it on the Internet for anyone to read. It outlines, in matter-of-fact prose and a disturbing level of detail, everything he thinks he's ever done wrong. It's not clear if this helped him, or if it simply seemed so strange that people didn't know what to make of it. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Dirty political attacks go back to the very beginning of the American Republic. What's different today, says historian Richard Norton Smith, is that television and the other electronic media have made our contact with the candidates so intimate. It has greater emotional impact on us because we see every wince cross a candidate's face. What could be more intimate than Jack E. Robinson's car crash, recorded on tape? (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
David Foster Wallace reports on a turning point in past Presidential primaries: The moment when John McCain failed to respond well to an attack by George Bush...which arguably ended up costing him the election. (19 minutes) _David Foster Wallace_

Act Three
Former political consultant Ron Susskind says that when he began in politics, he thought there was nothing lower than negative campaigning. But then in 1980 he learned that sometimes when your opponent attacks you, it can actually help you. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Four
There is an entire class of consultant who does nothing but help people and companies that are under public attack. Eric Dezenhall is one of them. He works for a crisis management firm in Washington DC, and has written a book about his craft, called Nail 'Em. (9 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Five
There's little in adult life that can hurt as much as a character assassination attack when it happens in junior high school. We hear the story of how one boy organizes the entire school against his former best friend, a guy named Bob Cucuzza. (15 minutes) _Paul Tough_

      <description>Imagine that you could somehow look down from above, onto all the streets and avenues and country roads and highways of this nation...each car below its own tiny subculture on wheels...glass and steel worlds rolling down the street alongside each other. We hear what's going on inside some of these cars.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass explains the premise of the show, and we hear what's actually going on inside five of these cars. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Linnel Peterson drives the Number 66 bus in Chicago, on Chicago Avenue. She grew up just blocks from the route, still lives near the route, and says it's strange whenever she drives her car on Chicago Avenue these days. She sees people waiting for the bus and momentarily heads over to pick them up. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Nick Hornby, author of High Fidelity and About a Boy , explains the travails of driving his autistic son to the park. (6 minutes) _Nick Hornby_

Act Three
Jay Allison and his 12-year-old daughter discuss what radio station to listen to. She wants music. He wants...public radio. She sighs in exasperation. And then—on public radio—comes a defense of everything she holds dear. Sort of. This story is one of Jay Allison's Life Stories series, funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. (9 minutes) _Jay Allison_

Act Four
An '88 Grand Marquis that Senator Conrad Burns inherited from his mother; a New York taxicab whose driver, Jeff Perkins, tape-records his passengers to help pass the time; a 1980s-era BMW 5 series in which film producer Rob Levine had his first job as driver and assistant to movie producer Edgar Sherrick. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Five
Ernest Castle and his best friend Clarence tool around the neighborhood where they grew up—the Chicago suburb of Hazelcrest—drinking and running into friends on a Sunday morning. (9 minutes) _Ernest Castle_

Act Six
David Sedaris, author of Me Talk Pretty One Day, explains how the most important moments of your life can happen in a car...and you can miss them. (4 minutes) _David Sedaris_

      <description>Stories of people who did not want to move but circumstance forced their hands, and so they tried to move without really moving.

Prologue
Ben Schrank describes what it's like to work as a professional mover. He says that people often go sort of nuts when they see all their worldly possessions—all the stuff that defines them as people—packed into a van. It's a humbling experience for people, and just one of the reasons people hate to move. The other reasons: It's hard starting in a new place; it's dreadful leaving an old place; and the process of moving itself is a hardship. So today...we have stories of people who were forced to move—but who did not want to and tried to thwart it. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
This is a story of people wanting to change and not wanting to change at all. A Minnesota family builds the same 1970s-era suburban house three times, and moves it once, just so they don't have to live in a house that's different than the house that contains all their memories. Susan Burton reports. (22 minutes) _Susan Burton_

Act Two
Sarah Koenig tells the story of how her stepsister Rue bought a house and moved in—but the former owner did not move out. And won't move out, until he dies. (16 minutes) _Sarah Koenig_

Act Three
Producer Blue Chevigny used to have a job that was all about Moving Day—and people who didn't want to move. She worked for an agency in New York called Project Reachout, part of Goddard Riverside Community Center, that moved homeless, mentally ill people into their own homes. She tells the story of one of her favorite clients, George, and how it took him eight years to get off the streets and into his own place. Blue records his moving day. (12 minutes) _Blue Chevigny_

      <description>Stories of a typically American kind of hero: The person who decides to fight city hall, who stands up alone for what's right, and damn the consequences. We hear the story of two idealists who work in government, two centuries after another set of idealists created the American government. Both of the modern idealists suffer and sacrifice because of their ideals; both lose their jobs.

Prologue
Monica Childs joined the Detroit police force because she hated cops, and wanted to change the system from the inside. She wanted to be an honest cop. Which she was able to do as she rose through the ranks—until one day in 1996, when it suddenly wasn't so easy any more. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Monica Childs's story continues. She tells the story of how she was asked by her boss to do something illegal...and how she refused...and the repercussions she suffered. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
A small-town mayor tries to keep a developer from building in his town...and it results in the kind of snowballing fiasco by the end of which the town literally doesn't exist anymore. Alix Spiegel tells that story, which she produced with funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. (34 minutes) _Alix Spiegel_

      <description>Every crime scene hides a story. In this week's show, we hear about crime scenes and the stories they tell.

Prologue
Medical Examiner L.J. Dragovic, in Pontiac, Michigan, explains how every crime scene is like a novel. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Forensic Criminologist Enrico Togneri in Nevada explains exactly what can be learned from evidence on a crime scene: What can be learned from the shape of a blood stain or a piece of cheese. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Reporter Nancy Updike spends two days with Neal Smither, who cleans up crime scenes for a living, and comes away wanting to open his Los Angeles franchise, despite the gore—or maybe because of it. (13 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Three
Sometimes criminals return to the scene of their misdeeds—to try to make things right, to try to undo the past. Katie Davis reports on her neighbor Bobby, who returned to the scene where he robbed people and conned people...to coach Little League. (21 minutes) _Katie Davis_

Act Four
Actor Matt Malloy reads a short story by Aimee Bender, from her book The Girl in the Flammable Skirt: Stories . (12 minutes) _Aimee Bender, Matt Malloy_

      <description>Many Americans have dreamy and romantic ideas about Paris, notions which probably trace back to the 1920s vision of Paris created by the expatriate Americans there. But what's it actually like in Paris if you're an American, without rose-colored glasses?

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with writer David Sedaris at the Louvre in Paris. David's never set foot inside, though he lives just a few minutes away. He says most people go to the Louvre because they think they should. Where he would take them if they wanted to see the city where he's lived for two years is very different.. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
David Sedaris takes Ira on a tour of his favorite spots in Paris. He moved to France with no special feelings for the place. His head wasn't full of Ernest Hemingway and Gertrude Stein and Sartre and Proust; he was a blank slate. And so the places he's found as his favorites tend to be places where the people aren't mean to him when he speaks French, or places where very unusual and fascinating objects are sold, or place that are unlike anywhere in the States.. David describes his struggle with daily life in France in his book Me Talk Pretty One Day . (27 minutes) _Ira Glass, David Sedaris_

Act Two
We hear from two Americans who live in Paris about what it is that draws the people who love France so much. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
Is Paris still the racially tolerant place that Richard Wright and James Baldwin discovered in the 1940s? Janet McDonald talks about whether African-Americans are still welcomed in Paris so warmly, even after a half century of African migration to the city. Also: Why it's sometimes better for her to put on a bad American accent. Janet wrote the book Project Girl . (16 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>Three stories that consider the question: Does anyone's family ever change?

Prologue
Host Ira Glass describes a children's book from the 1970s called Nobody's Family Is Going to Change by Louise Fitzhugh, the author of Harriet the Spy . On the surface, it sounds like a rather menacing title for a kids' book. But in fact, the story is about how kids can finally find peace if they stop hoping that their parents will ever be any different. The question is, though: Is it true? Does anyone's family ever change? (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Julia Pimsleur travels to Alaska to spend some time with her brother, hoping he might change a little—just as he hopes that she'll change a little. She made a documentary film about her trip, from which the sound in this story comes, called Brother Born Again . (30 minutes) _Julia Pimsleur_

Act Two
What can happen if a sibling relationship doesn't ever change. Hillary Frank brings us the story of two sisters, now in their seventies, who have preserved the same relationship they had as girls...for better or worse. (9 minutes) _Hillary Frank_

Act Three
What happens when you want your dad to change—and he wants to change, too—but there's literally nothing that can be done to change him. Jon Sarkin was a chiropractor with workaholic tendencies. Then in 1988, something changed in his brain, something his family is still getting used to. (14 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>Stories of people who are engaged in something that's both difficult and probably futile: Trying to control how they'll be seen by generations to come.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass tells the story of a time capsule project designed to document our lives so that people a thousand years from now can know what we were like. Ira explains that when a friend of his got involved in the time capsule, Ira realized that he hates the people of the future. But lots of people don't. Lots of people worry about how they'll be remembered. This show is about that sad, sad lot. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Sarah Vowell visits four Presidential libraries on a fact-finding tour for...President Clinton. Not that he asked her. But she wanted to offer a little advice about what should and should not be in the Presidential library he'll soon be building in Arkansas. Rejected titles for this act of our show: "Can You Direct Me to the Dick Morris Exhibit?," "The Last and Longest Press Conference," "How a Bill Becomes an Archive," "All the President's Pens," "It's the Eternity, Stupid," and "If This Library Be A Rockin, Don't Come a Knockin." (25 minutes) _Sarah Vowell_

Act Two
What if you're remembered in ways that you don't like? What if you're remembered for something someone else did? In this act, we consider the case of Marguerite Oswald, mother of Lee Harvey Oswald. In 1965 she spent three days with reporter Jean Stafford, who wrote about Mrs. Oswald for McCall's magazine and later in a book called A Mother in History . This American Life producer Susan Burton tracked down the tapes of the interview to the University of Colorado in Boulder. According to the librarians in the Special Collections there, this is the first time the tapes have been played publicly—possibly the first time the tapes have ever been heard by anyone but Jean Stafford and Mrs. Oswald herself. On the tapes, Marguerite Oswald defends her parenting skills against the conclusions of the Warren Commission Report . (13 minutes) _Susan Burton_

Act Three
After he died, Albert Einstein became a figure of international kitsch: Appearing in computer and Pepsi ads, showing up a comic character in movies with Meg Ryan, and until very recently his brain was on the loose without his family's consent...in the unauthorized possession of the doctor who did the autopsy, a man named Thomas Harvey. Mike Paterniti took a cross-country roadtrip with Dr Harvey and the brain. At one point, in search of the global epicenter of those who've attached themselves to Einstein after the physicist's death, Mike headed to Japan. He reads an excerpt from his book Driving Mr. Albert: A Trip Across America with Einstein's Brain. (14 minutes) _Mike Paterniti_

      <description>There are all sorts of situations in which we suspect the fix is in, but we almost never find out for certain. On today's show, for once, we find out. The whole program is devoted to one story, in which we go inside the back rooms of one multinational corporation and hear the intricate workings—recorded on tape—of how they put the fix in.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass speaks with two people who believe they've uncovered behind-the-scenes conspiracies but can't be sure. Attorney Andy Hail has sued the two biggest supermarkets in Chicago (Dominick's and Jewel) because they charge a dollar more for milk than stores around the country, and because their prices seem to change simultaneously, as if orchestrated. Cindi Canary from the Illinois Campaign for Political Reform tells the story of an Illinois law that seems to mostly benefit one man—the man who made sure it made it though the legislature. (8 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
We hear the first part of our story about Archer Daniels Midland and FBI informant Mark Whitacre. In this half, Whitacre inadvertently ends up a cooperating witness—and turns himself into one of the best cooperating witnesses in the history of U.S. law enforcement, gathering evidence with an adeptness few have matched. (25 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Our story about ADM and Mark Whitacre continues. The FBI finds out that their star cooperating witness Mark Whitacre has been lying to them for three years about some rather serious matters. (22 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>We as a nation declared our independence based on, among other things, the right to pursue our happiness. But what does it mean, over two centuries later, to grow up in a country with an inalienable right to pursue happiness? Stories of people pursuing happiness, and sometimes, achieving it.

Prologue
Ira talks with producer Blue Chevigny about how a prank caller taught her that when it comes to pursuing happiness, Carole King, the world of independent cinema and the New York City Police Department have a lot more in common than she ever imagined. He also talks with MIT Professor Pauline Maier, author of the book American Scripture: Making the Declaration of Independence . (10 minutes) _Blue Chevigny, Ira Glass_

Act One
David Rakoff tells a story about an actual pursuit—a scavenger hunt—that takes hundreds of hours to create ... done for the sheer pleasure of it. (18 minutes) _David Rakoff_

Act Two
Thomas Beller tells the story of how we go from innocently amusing ourselves, to less innocent activities—all in the pursuit of happiness. It's an excerpt from his novel The Sleep-over Artist. (7 minutes) _Thomas Beller_

Act Three
Every year, the Emerald Society, an association of Irish Chicago police officers, flies in policemen from New York City for Chicago's two big St. Patrick's Day Parades. Every year they're met by a group of Chicago South Side women, who are big big fans of the NYPD. This American Life producer Julie Snyder tells the story. (11 minutes)

Act Four
Finding happiness is serious business. At least, for most us, it requires an act of will. Nancy Updike tells the story of a boxing coach named Marcus Johnson, and how he decided to turn something that made him unhappy...into the opposite. (18 minutes)

      <description>We live in a big enough country that there are lots of laws too obscure for most of us to have heard of...but which actually affect tens of thousands of lives in huge ways. This show deals with one of them: A 1996 immigration law that theImmigration Serviceitself says is unfair. Most of the law's original sponsors in Congress now say they went too far, and that they were too harsh when they passed the law. And yet most of the law's key provisions still stand unchanged.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass goes to jail in Bristol County, Massachussetts, where there's a large Portuguese community, and where even a law-and-order sheriff named Tom Hodgson opposes this particular immigration law. He also talks with inmate Jorge Aruda, who's being deported for a crime he already served his sentence for. (8 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Producer Blue Chevigny tells more of the story from Bristol County, where the immigration law of 1996 has a community of non-political people reluctantly going to protests, attending meetings at night, talking to politicians, and doing all sorts of other things most of us would do anything to avoid. (16 minutes) _Blue Chevigny_

Act Two
Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman Bill Strassberger explains why INS opposes parts of the 1996 immigration law, even while it enforces it. Congressman Barney Frank—whose district includes Bristol County—argues that most of his colleagues in Congress had no idea what they were voting for when they voted for key portions of the law. And an advocate for the law, John Martin from the Federation for American Immigration Reform, explains why we actually should want to deport more people. (12 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
What happens if the immigration service wants to deport you, but the country you came from won't take you back? Under current law, usually, you stay in jail...indefinitely. Writer Alex Kotlowitz tells the story of one legal alien from Vietnam, Trung Tran, and the unusually close and friendly relationships he and his fellow deportees have with their captors in a jail in Victoria, Texas. (18 minutes) _Alex Kotlowitz_

      <description>Stories for the eve of the Presidential election, in which we try to evade, sidestep or look beneath the candidates' soundbites.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with Bennett Miller and Matt Futterman about a campaign for student government that changed the way student elections were done in Mamaroneck High School back in 1985. Futterman, in the waning days of his campaign, tried a radical tactic: A TV ad. It led to a wave of television ads for student office at the school, most of which misunderstood what made Futterman's ad so successful. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
A Michigan millionaire tries to swing his swing state, using only his voice, his millions, and major market radio ad time. A report on Jeffrey Fieger, who helped swing his state to McCain during the primaries with several irreverant attack ads against Bush. In this age when we all wish our politicians would shoot from the hip, Fieger delivers, for good and bad. Contributing editor Jack Hitt goes with Fieger to the studio, as Fieger records a new set of anti-Bush spots for the general election. (13 minutes) _Jack Hitt_

Act Two
The 2000 election season was strange in that many of the issues that the candidates debated most heatedly were ones that most of us have no handle on—prescription drug policy, social security solvency...and educational accountability. Producer Alex Blumberg travels to North Carolina, a state where many of the promises both candidates make regarding education are already in place. He finds, not surprisingly, that they work better as soundbite than as policy, and that if the two candidates get their way with education, it'll push it in a direction most North Carolina teachers find alarming. (23 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

Act Three
Reporter Adam Davidson is related to George W. Bush. You might be too. By some freak of genealogy, half of all Americans are, if they just delve back far enough. But Adam has six 17th-century relatives in common with George Bush...and it perplexes him. How did the Bushes become a dynasty, while Adam has to borrow money from his girlfriend for the rent? He consults genealogist Gary Boyd Roberts about what the Bush family did right and where the Davidson family went wrong. Adam's family tree, linking him to George W.—is online here. (11 minutes) _Adam Davidson_

      <description>We document one day in a Chicago diner called the Golden Apple, starting at 5 a.m. and going until 5 a.m. the next morning. We hear from the waitress who has worked the graveyard shift for over two decades, the regular customers who come every day, the couples working out their problems, assorted drunks, and, of course, cops.

Act One
In this act, we hear several stories that happened during the daylight hours of the diner's operation. The first is from Nancy Updike, who talks with early morning customers, including one guy who comes in mornings to play his accordion, and another who at the age of 8 was the youngest butcher in Illinois. We also hear from several regulars who come to the Golden Apple every day, more than once. Many of them are old and alone. They say they come for the coffee, and to talk to the waitresses. Reporter Susan Burton talks with two friends who used to be a couple. They stopped dating three years ago, but haven't stopped fighting about whose fault it was. An older lady who grew up in the neighborhood explains her neighbors' feelings towards African Americans and gay people. (29 minutes) _Susan Burton, Ira Glass, Nancy Updike_

Act Two
In this act, we hear from the rowdier, drunker late-night patrons of the Golden Apple. A guy walks in with two young women, hoping to go home with one of them. A woman explains the difference between earthly time and other kinds of time. Two teenaged girls, best friends, spend four hours trying to meet a guy named Jeff at the diner. Two cops talk about TV, what they do on their breaks, and how sometimes it's okay to drive around all night on their beat doing nothing. (26 minutes) _Wendy Dorr, Ira Glass_

      <description>A story of self-deception, a story about deceiving others, and a story about accidental deception. And how one type of deception can easily turn into another.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass reads an excerpt from Nick Hornby's novel About a Boy . The narrator, Will, recalls a time when he was a child that he convinced a friend that a portal to another world existed at the back of his closet. Will knew that the portal didn't exist, but continued the lie for some reason, even as he and his friend crawled through the winter coats by the closet baseboards looking for a hidden gateway. He just kept hoping that maybe they'd find something. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass, Nick Hornby_

Act One
Producer Alex Blumberg tells the story of an ex-con-turned-actor named Richie Castellano. After a bit role in the movie Analyze This , he moved to a small town and got dozens of people to invest money and time in a movie that never premiered. Why so many people bought into his grandiose dreams, and what they learned about him—and themselves—after they got burned for it. (22 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

Act Two
Lawrence Otis Graham reads from an account of how he left his job as a $105,000-a-year Manhattan attorney to enter the exclusive Greenwich Country Club the only way they'd allow a black man like him: as a busboy. He discovers just how invisible he can become once he gives up his seat at the table and starts clearing the dishes instead—so invisible that people make racist remarks right in front of him. The passage is from his book A Member of the Club: Reflections on Life in a Racially Polarized World . (16 minutes) _Lawrence Otis Graham_

Act Three
David Sedaris tells the story of a subway ride he took in Paris. Two American tourists mistake him for a Frenchman and, thinking he can't speak English, begin to talk loudly about how he smells. Later, they come to believe that he's a pickpocket. He starts off hating this, but comes to enjoy it. The story's from his book Me Talk Pretty One Day . (12 minutes) _David Sedaris_

      <description>They mean something, whether we want them to or not.

Prologue
We hear the story of a disastrous birthday party and how it's hard not to see these kinds of moments as symbolic of something bad. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Sarah Vowell takes over the family Thanksgiving dinner by bringing everyone to New York. What results is a series of milestones and family firsts. Everyone in the family is the kind of person who prefers to be alone, so the very thing that binds them together as a family actually makes it hard for them to spend time together. (14 minutes) _Sarah Vowell_

Act Two
The story of Tyler Cassity and how he's trying to remake one of our oldest rituals of commemoration. Tyler is one of the owners of a cemetery called Hollywood Forever, and he's been introducing 20th century technology to American funerals, which haven't changed much since the Civil War. At Hollywood Forever, the cost of a burial includes a video of your life: to be shown at your funeral, to be viewable at kiosks on the cemetery grounds, and to be posted—for eternity—online. (16 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
On a commemorative day, it can be hard to feel a real sense of the past and of how time has moved forward. Russell Banks has a story demonstrating what it might take to do just that. He reads "The Moor," from his collection of short fiction The Angel on the Roof . (19 minutes) _Russell Banks_

      <description>What goes on while mom and dad are away, that mom and dad never find out about. Including the story of two teenagers who decide to invent children to babysit, as an excuse to get out of their own house.

Prologue
We listen in on a ritual that happens in millions of families every week: kids getting dropped off at the babysitters. Six-year-old Dylan and nine-year-old Sarah explain what they can and can't get away with when they have a babysitter. After that, host Ira Glass has a few words about Mary Poppins, who is the Gold Standard of all fictional babysitters. The movie Mary Poppins contains the classic modern song about babysitting. We hear several versions of the song over the course of the program. The first is by Chicago girl punk/pop band, the Dishes. Download song: "The Perfect Nanny, from Mary Poppins", The Dishes (5 minutes)

Act One
Lots of babysitting is done by family members. Hillary Frank reports on what can happen when a teenaged son is put in charge of his younger brothers. It's not pretty. Hillary is the writer of the fictional podcast, “ Here Lies Me .” The Mary Poppins song in this act is performed by Jon Langford, with John Rice on mandolin. Download : "The Perfect Nanny, from Mary Poppins", Jon Langford (14 minutes) _Hillary Frank_

Act Two
The story of several huge companies that accidentally got put into the babysitting business in a big, big way because of snow on December 26, 1988. Every year on the day after Christmas, divorced kids all over America fly from one parent to the other. In 1988, lots of them got snowed in at O'Hare Airport in Chicago. Susan Burton and her little sister were among them. This story was turned into the 2006 movie Unaccompanied Minors . (9 minutes) _Susan Burton_

Act Three
Myron Jones and his sister Carol Bove explain what happened when they were teenagers, and they ended up babysitting children who didn't exist. (25 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>In the wake of the 2001 election debacle in Florida, the two political halves of this country seemed angrier at each other than they had in decades. This week we bring you tales of that widening rift. Democrats explain why they're having trouble getting over it, and Republicans explain why this is so infuriating.

Prologue
We got a new President, but after the recount mess in Florida in the fall of 2001 and the Supreme Court decision that ended the election, some people were having a hard time moving on. Why? Why couldn't they just let it go? Host Ira Glass talks with people at the inauguration. Republican Chris Robling talks with a Democratic friend. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Jonathan Chait of The New Republic and David Horowitz of Slate magazine each tell the story of the Florida recount. There is astonishingly little overlap in their accounts. It's not just that they interpret the facts differently; they don't agree on the facts either. (8 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Writer David Brock gives us the inside story of how we got to this point of bitterness. It is not a pretty story. (11 minutes) _David Brock_

Act Three
When it comes to political fighting, there's no more intimate a space than a marriage, where you have to get along. Where you have to figure out how to move on and get over disagreement. Living in Nashville, Tennessee, Scott and Carrie Rayson agreed about politics until this year—when it became the one subject in their marriage that they cannot discuss. (11 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Four
We return to the Supreme Court case of Bush vs. Gore to try to better understand why the majority ruled the way it did...and whether the decision was in fact as outrageous as many critics said it was. Four legal scholars explain: Jeffry Rosen, Mike McConnell, Pam Karlan and Greg Sisk. (14 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Five
A chat with Reverend Richard Harris, an African-American minister in Florida who's trying not to be angry about the election...because it's against his religion. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>Stories of people living completely outside the grid of American life. Americans in Paris. Chinese in America. West Virginians in treehouses. Mexican-Americans in Rochester.

Prologue
Ira talks with Lee Qi, who came to America from China. He worked in Chinese restaurants in small towns, live in tiny apartments with other illegal immigrants who worked there as well—apartments that were sometimes in the back of the restaurants. He couldn't speak English, didn't go to school. He was 15. It was like being in limbo, he says: Here in America, but not part of it at all. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
The Jarvis family, a group of eight, goes on the run from the law—for seven years. They live on a boat, in a treehouse in a swamp. They escape capture time after time. And how do the kids turn out, living a life outside of society, as fugitives? Surprisingly great. (23 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

Act Two
Adam Gopnik reads a story from his book Paris to the Moon , about living in Paris with his family and wanting his son to be a bit more American. He tells him a bedtime story about the most American thing he can think of: baseball. But it doesn't work out the way he planned. (18 minutes) _Adam Gopnik_

Act Three
Sylvia becomes the first person in her Mexican-American family to go away to college, at a predominantly white school in upstate New York. As all her cousins at home get married, start families, and seem happier than she is, she wonders why, exactly, is her route the better one? Sylvia first talked about her experiences with her mother and family in high school in our " Escape the Box " show in 1998. (11 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>We answer the following questions about superpowers: Can superheroes be real people? (No.) Can real people become superheroes? (Maybe.) And which is better: flight or invisibility? (Depends who you ask.)

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks to comic artist Chris Ware, who thought about superheroes a lot of the time as a kid. In grade school, Chris drew superheroes, he invented his own character named The Hurricane (not to be confused with Reuben Carter), and he made a superhero costume. Sometimes he wore parts of the costume to school under his regular clothes, which went fine until he realized he would have to change clothes for gym class. Click below to see the comic Chris made about this story. His book, Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth , is also inhabited by a "superhero" of sorts. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
John Hodgman conducts an informal survey in which he asks the age-old question: Which is better: The power of flight or the power of invisibility? He finds that how you answer tells a lot about what kind of person you are. And also, no matter which power people choose, they never use it to fight crime. (14 minutes) _John Hodgman_

Act Two
Kelly McEvers with the story of Zora, a self-made superhero. From the time she was five, Zora had recurring dreams in which she was a 6'5" warrior queen who could fly and shoot lightning from her hands. She made a list of all the skills she would need to master if she wanted to actually become the superhero she dreamed of being. Sample items: Martial arts, evasive driving and bomb diffusion. She actually checked off most things on the list...and then had a run-in with the CIA. (17 minutes) _Kelly McEvers_

Act Three
Ira talks with Jonathan Morris, the amazingly funny and charming editor of the website Gone and Forgotten , an Internet archive of failed comic book characters. Jonathan explains what makes a new superhero succeed, and what makes him tank. (9 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Four
Ira talks with journalist Jason Bleibtreu about Luther and Johnny Htoo, twelve-year-old twins, and the leaders of a rebel army of Burmese separatists called God's Army. Everyone around them, both their own forces and their enemies, believed they possessed superpowers, that they could not be harmed by bullets, that they had the power to command ghost armies. Bleibtrau visited the twins while they were in the jungle and explains why they were so widely believed. (9 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Prologue
We hear from Father Jim Kastigar, who got on the wrong side of Town Hall and suffered the kinds of consequences people in Cicero suffer. His parish was denied a permit to hold an outdoor religious ceremony they'd held peacefully for seven years, the youth group's tamale fundraiser was shut down by city inspectors and the parking lot near the church was deemed unfit for Sunday parking. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
To understand how Cicero reacted when Hispanics started flooding into town, you have to understand how it dealt with conflict in the past. For a period the town was run by Al Capone, and the mob was connected to Town Hall for most of the twentieth century. Since the 1950s, the town also had the reputation of being "the Selma of the North," with black people being driven from town by angry mobs while the authorities turned the other cheek; and a police chief who wore a t-shirt that says, "Police Brutality: The Fun Part of Police Work." (7 minutes) _Ira Glass, Alex Kotlowitz_

Act Two
In the 1970s and 1980s, a wave of non-white migration into Cicero begins, this one primarily Mexican-American. The head of the political machine is named Betty Loren-Maltese, whose husband, now deceased, was convicted for mob-related activity. She responds to the newcomers with some of the intimidation tactics of the past, but also with some new ones that no town anywhere seems to have tried. (13 minutes) _Ira Glass, Alex Kotlowitz_

Act Three
Despite the town's resistance, Hispanics now make up three quarters of the population. And yet the incumbent Town President, Betty Loren-Maltese, seems likely to win the next election. We learn how she's maintaining her hold on power. (10 minutes) _Ira Glass, Alex Kotlowitz_

Act Four
Two stories about daily life in Cicero. First the tale of Dave Boyle, who stumbled into Cicero politics accidentally in the 1980s, suffered the bruises, and left town. But he found he couldn't stay away. Then, the most surprising finding of all: If you walk the neighborhoods of Cicero, you discover that despite all the ways that Town Hall antagonized its own Hispanic citizens, most people are getting along just fine. There are rough moments, sure, but things are way more calm than Cicero's history would lead you to expect. We hear the story of three neighbors: Annie, Loretta and Nancy. (20 minutes) _Ira Glass, Alex Kotlowitz_

      <description>Stories of people who try to revisit their childhoods. What they find. And what they do not find.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with Kayla Hernandez, a seventh-grader who likes to reminisce about when she was a child, back in fifth grade. She visits Room 211 in her school, where her fifth grade class met, and looks at her old books, thinks about what happened there. She says she knows that decades from now, she won't even remember most of what's happening to her this year, in seventh grade, and that makes her sad. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Jonathan Katz listens to old tapes of his family; then travels back to the neighborhood in Brooklyn they lived in during the 1950s, looking for evidence of what his childhood was like. His sister is along for the trip, and they do not agree on the meaning of what they're seeing. A collaboration between This American Life and Lost and Found Sound . (13 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
A mortgage broker named David Philp discovers that his old punk band from the 1970s is hot in Japan. He decides to leave corporate life and revisit his teenage years by going back on tour, playing music for the first time in two decades. (12 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
Producer Alex Blumberg sets out to find a woman named Susan Jordan, who babysat him and his sister for a year when he was nine. He discovers that each of them remembered something about the other that the other would just as soon forget. (20 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

Act Four
An excerpt from Nicholson Baker's novel The Everlasting Story of Nory , which is narrated, more or less, by a ten-year-old. In this excerpt, we return to what Kayla Hernandez talked about in the prologue to the show: The narrator discusses the difficulty of remembering what happens on any given day. It's read by Michelle Trachtenberg, from the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. (5 minutes) _Nicholson Baker, Michelle Trachtenberg_

      <description>A special show, composed entirely of stories from just oneThis American Lifecontributor: Scott Carrier, whose strange and compelling stories sound like nothing else on the radio.

Prologue
Ira tells the story about how Scott first got into radio. He was listening to a story on the radio one day, thought "I can do that," and promptly hitchhiked across the country to Washington, to the headquarters of NPR. (3 minutes) _Scott Carrier, Ira Glass_

Act One
At a fairly bleak time in his life, Scott took a job driving all over the state of Utah, interviewing people who were diagnosed with schizophrenia. His job was to administer a standard test, which measured mental health. The more interviews he conducted and the more familiar he became with the questions on the test, the more he began to wonder about his own sanity. (15 minutes) _Scott Carrier_

Act Two
It's another not-so-great period in Scott's life. This time he takes a job inside his profession, as a producer for a national commercial radio program. His boss is a nationally recognized host who Scott refers to only as "The Friendly Man." Again, things don't go so well. (16 minutes) _Scott Carrier_

Act Three
Scott goes on a quest to discover if the amnesia in the movies—where someone gets bonked on the head and forgets everything—ever happens in real life. And if so, could he, somehow, get it to happen to him? (13 minutes) _Scott Carrier_

Act Four
Scott interviews his 11-year-old daughter about his marriage. She sheds light on the previous three stories in the show. (7 minutes) _Scott Carrier_

      <description>Stories that make us cringe, and an investigation into just what, exactly, makes some stories capable of forcing this physical reaction out of us when other stories don't. We hear tales of personal humiliation, romance gone wrong, and people who profoundly misjudge how they're perceived by others.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks to two different people who have stories they just can't get over...stories that make them cringe...and stories from which we can glean what makes a cringe story different from other kinds of stories. (8 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Cringing means literally "to shrink from something dangerous or painful." So what could be more potentially dangerous or painful—more cringe-worthy—than love? Nancy Updike reports on the characteristics and bylaws of cringe love. (11 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Two
Ira reports on a week he spent on the set of the TV show M*A*S*H in 1979, supposedly to do a story about the program for National Public Radio. He was 20 years old. He didn't know what he was doing. This week, he listened to the tapes for the first time in over two decades and found much to cringe at. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
Adam Davidson reads from his high school diaries. _Adam Davidson_

Act Four
A lot of stories from your life, the more you tell them, the less power they have over you. But cringe stories often don't seem to lose their power over time. Every time you remember, you cringe. Bruce Jay Friedman reads his story "Humiliation," from The Collected Short Fiction of Bruce Jay Friedman , about someone who gets obsessed with a decades-old cringe moment...and decides to do something about it. (15 minutes) _Bruce Jay Friedman_

      <description>Stories about the legacy of absent parents. We hear four cases from the files of the Missing Parents Bureau.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with Cate, a white woman with a black, adopted, seven-year-old son, Glen. Sometimes Glen threatens that he's going to return to his real family—royalty, in Africa. The only thing is, Glen's not adopted from Africa. He's adopted from Chicago. But this is the way it goes: Even if there are real parents out there somewhere, sometimes it's more comforting for a kid to believe in a fantasy. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Most sperm banks provide all sorts of information about their donors: Education level, medical background. They even have videotaped interviews and recorded answers to essay questions. But not all clients take advantage of this information. In fact, lots of women choose to avoid it. Reporter Alix Spiegel talks with single women who are planning to get pregnant with the help of a sperm bank and finds that they all wrestle with the question of how much they want to know about the fathers of their kids—and how much they want their kids to know. Alix's story was produced in part with a grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Recorded at Chicago's Audi Home Juvenile Detention Facility, the song was part of a show put on by Chicago's Music Theatre Workshop. (20 minutes) _Alix Spiegel_

Act Two
We hear a series of letters that originally appeared on the brief-lived, little-known, but well-loved webzine Open Letters . They're written by a woman who signs her name as "X" and are addressed to the father of her adolescent son. X has no idea where to send the letters, but she keeps writing. Since the letters' original publication on the Internet, X has decided to reveal her identity. Her name is Miriam Toews, and she's author of the book Swing Low, A Life . Her letters were read for us by Alexa Junge. (17 minutes) _Alexa Junge, Miriam Toews_

Act Three
When Starlee Kine was a kid, she wanted to be a child star so badly that she signed up for an acting class with a famous acting teacher named Kevin McDermott. One of the class's exercises was to develop a character with a troubled past, and a real psychologist would come in for a session of character group therapy. Starlee chose to take on the character of an orphan. In fact, Starlee remembers that everyone else in her class did too. Twenty years later, she visits her old acting teacher in Los Angeles and discovers that for some reason, kids today don't want to be orphans. (9 minutes) _Starlee Kine_

Act Four
In Seattle, Dan Savage and his boyfriend adopted a son, DJ. It was an open adoption, so the birth mother could keep in touch with her kid. But things haven't gone according to plan. Dan's written a book about adopting DJ, which this story is not part of, called The Kid: (What Happened After My Boyfriend and I Decided to Go Get Pregnant) . (6 minutes) _Dan Savage_

      <description>Stories of people trying to love their neighbors, and failing.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks to the Arnold Abbott, the founder of "Love Thy Neighbor," a Florida charity that's being sued by "Love Your Neighbor," a Michigan ministry and business. "Love Your Neighbor" owns the trademark on the phrases "Love Your Neighbor" and "Love Thy Neighbor;" the attorney for the Michigan business Julie Greenberg, contemplates whether suing a neighbor can fall within the category of loving them as yourself. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
When he was just a kid, Davy Rothbart and his family visited the most famous neighbor in America—Mr. Rogers—at his summer cottage on Nantucket. Two decades later, as an adult, Davy went back for another visit with Mr. Rogers. This time he brought stories from his own neighborhood, stories of neighborly conflict and distrust—to see what kind of advice Mr. Rogers could give him. (20 minutes) _Davy Rothbart_

Act Two
What happens when the kid next door wants to be your new friend...and comes over, tries to talk to you, befriends your dog. Are you a bad person if you don't want to accept the tiny hand of friendship? Cheryl Wagner tells the story of her young, persistent next-door neighbor. A version of this story first appeared at Open Letters. (11 minutes) _Cheryl Wagner_

Act Three
What happens when a good neighbor goes bad. Katie Davis lives on a block where everyone wants to get along, and they're trying, even though one of their favorite neighbors has dozens of rats infesting her yard and attacking other houses. (20 minutes) _Katie Davis_

      <description>Stories of people worshiping false idols, and whether that's always a bad thing.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks to Bible scholars Paulene A. Viviano of Loyola University and John Spencer of John Carroll University about the story of the golden calf in the book of Exodus. It turns out that in fact there were Israelites who did pray to golden calves, and that the Bible was the scripture of their rivals in Jerusalem. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
One way to measure the faith—the good old-fashioned faith—that people put in celebrities is to examine what people ask of them. Ann Hepperman has a story that gives a rare and vivid glimpse of what people want from celebrities...or anyway, what they want from country legend Willie Nelson. Thanks to all the people who called Willie Nelson and gave us permission to broadcast their answering machine messages to him. (18 minutes) _Ann Heppermann_

Act Two
If you're in thrall to a pair of pants, is that such a bad thing? Ira talks to Kate—who invested her hopes and dreams in a pair of favorite trousers—and her husband Joel, who thought she was nuts. (12 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
You can't do a radio show about worshiping false gods without a story about money...or real estate...or hipness. Fortunately for us, Iggy Scam supplies a story that's about all three. It's the story of a couple trying to cash in on the San Francisco real estate boom, without the greatest success. (17 minutes) _Iggy Scam_

      <description>While the seniors danced at Prom Night 2001 in Hoisington, Kansas—a town of about 3,000—a tornado hit the town, destroying about a third of it. When they emerged from the dance, they discovered what had happened, and in the weeks that followed, they tried to explain to themselves why the tornado hit where it did. Plus other stories that happen on Prom Night.

Prologue
A high school boy explains how prom is the culmination of his effort to get in with a cool group of people. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Susan Burton reports on Prom Night 2001 in Hoisington, Kansas, a town of about 3,000. While the seniors danced, a tornado hit the town, destroying about a third of it.

Act Three
For a more typical view of prom night, we hear prom night at Chicago's Taft High School. This story first aired on NPR's All Things Considered. (9 minutes) _Ira Glass_

In this act, we argue that the epicenter of prom genius—the place where America's prom future is being born—is the town of Racine, Wisconsin. In Racine, they've added one ingredient to prom that takes it to a whole new level of intensity. Reported by Wendy Dorr. Special thanks to OVO Incorporated, an arts collective in New York. It's from them we heard about the prom in Racine. They made a film about it called World's Best Prom and were very helpful. (10 minutes) _Wendy Dorr_

      <description>For Father's Day, stories of dads who are utterly human in scale.

Prologue
Leah remembers when her parents got divorced and her dad, a farmer in North Dakota, moved to an apartment in town. It was cramped and ugly, and it had a Murphy bed that made a horrible creak when you brought it down from the wall. It was the first time she'd seen him look vulnerable, and not at all the heroic can-do guy he once was to her. At some point, of course, every dad comes down off the pedestal; it's just that some do it more gracefully than others. This, she says, was too early, too sudden. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
A collection of small stories, all on the the theme introduced in the prologue—the first few months after the divorce, and suddenly, your parents are less composed, more flawed, and more human, than perhaps you've ever seen them. (13 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Ian Brown explains the lengths a normal dad will go to give his daughter a memorable birthday party, including a birthday stunt so crass that he and his wife shocked all their friends. Ian Brown is the author of Man, Medium Rare and Freewheeling , and the host of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's program Talking Books. (13 minutes) _Ian Brown_

Act Three
Nick Flynn tells the story of his father, who was never on a pedestal. His father abandoned the family soon after Nick was born. Nick never knew him. Until one day, after Nick had graduated from college and started working at a homeless shelter, his father showed up needing a bed. Nick Flynn is the author of a book of poems called Some Ether . He's working on a book about his father. (23 minutes) _Nick Flynn_

      <description>Stories of kids using perfectly logical arguments, and arriving at perfectly wrong conclusions.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with Rebecca, who, using perfectly valid evidence, arrived at the perfectly incorrect conclusion that her neighbor, Ronnie Loeberfeld, was the tooth fairy. We hear her story. Ira also talks with Dr. Alison Gopnik, co-author of the book, The Scientist in the Crib , about what exactly kid logic is. Alison is also author of The Philosophical Baby . (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
More stories like the one in the prologue, where kids look at something going on around them, observe it carefully, think about it logically, and come to conclusions that are completely incorrect. Includes a story set at Christmastime, where a father tells his daughter about the baby Jesus being born, and all the "good stuff." Then the daughter notices a picture of Jesus on the cross, and asks why they killed him. The child later asks about Martin Luther King, Jr. (11 minutes) _Ira Glass, Jonathan Goldstein, Jack Hitt_

Act Two
Howie Chackowicz tried a risky combination when he was little, kid logic with puppy love. He used to think that girls would fall in love with him if they could just see him sleeping, or if they could hear him read aloud. He revisits his biggest childhood crush and finds out that not only did his methods not work, but that no one even noticed them. (11 minutes) _Howie Chackowicz_

Act Three
Michael Chabon reads an excerpt from his short story Werewolves in Their Youth , from his collection of the same name, about an act of kid logic that succeeds where adult logic fails. His most recent book is Telegraph Avenue . (16 minutes) _Michael Chabon_

Act Four
Julie Hill with a story about her six-year-old son, and how he tries to make sense of his father's terminal illness. (11 minutes) _Julie Hill_

      <description>Nearly this entire show is devoted to the story of the boat known as "Hitler's Yacht." It's a modern-day fable about what happens when the free market, the media, the World War II buffs, the Neo-Nazis, and the Jews all collide over a huge Nazi tourist trap. The boat arrived in America after World War II, and though there's no evidence that Hitler ever set foot on the decks, the name was attached to the vessel in the 1950s, and it stuck. Reporter Alix Spiegel describes the story of the vessel as "the biography of a collective fantasy."

Prologue
Host Ira Glass joins a group of tourists to walk through the captured German submarine that's on permanent display at Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry. He notes that the Museum chooses to underplay the murderous Nazi origins of the boat. He then makes some broad generalizations that lead, inevitably, to the introduction to our story on Hitler's Yacht. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Reporter Alix Spiegel tells the story of the Ostwind, the boat that came to be known as "Hitler's Yacht." (25 minutes) _Alix Spiegel_

Act Two
Alix Spiegel's story continues. (28 minutes) _Alix Spiegel_

      <description>Stories for the stultifying, torpor-inducing, hottest heat of summer.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass reports from Holstein Park Pool in Chicago. (3 minutes)

Act One
Like many summer stories, this one from Scott Carrier begins with a whim and ends with a whimper. He travels cross-country without air conditioning, during weather in which it's too hot to stay in the car and too hot to get out. (29 minutes) _Scott Carrier, Ira Glass_

Act Two
Jonathan Goldstein heads into an environment that's so hot that they people there believe that sweating—simply sweating—is getting something accomplished. Life in the Division Street Russian Bath turns out to follow a different—and superior—set of rules to life elsewhere. Jonathan's the author of the novels Lenny Bruce is Dead and Ladies and Gentlemen, The Bible! . (14 minutes) _Jonathan Goldstein_

Act Three
Sarah Vowell brings us the story of a national dispute involving Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico, a sandwich, park rangers, scientists, and the United States Congress. Scott Carrier and Sarah Vowell's stories were produced with help from HearingVoices.com , with funds from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. (14 minutes) _Sarah Vowell_

      <description>The story of one man's journey from obscurity to international professional celebrity—aided only by his own hard work, a sneaker commercial, and mad handles. And other stories of amateurs hurtling themselves at the pros whose jobs they covet.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with Stephen Goldin, author of an online guide that prescribes 23 rules for comic fans to follow when mingling with professional sci-fi authors at sci-fi conventions. For instance: don't try to start a discussion with a pro on the way to the bathroom. And this week, Ira explains, breaks eight of the 23 rules. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
The story of two amateurs meeting the pros. One is a teenager in New Jersey; the other, our reporter. Joel Lovell visits 19-year-old Luis Da Silva, one of the stars of a popular series of Nike commercials featuring professional and amateur basketball players doing dribbling tricks. Luis didn't even start for his high school basketball team. (17 minutes) _Joel Lovell_

Act Two
Ira travels to Las Vegas for the World Series of Poker , gets hooked, and tries to figure out what it would mean if he'd ditch his job in radio to become a professional card player. What he learns: A professional gambler can suffer two heartbreaking losses back-to-back, costing him over $100,000, and moments later, at the casino bar, calculate the million-to-one odds of his unlikely losses...in his head. (26 minutes) _Ira Glass, Starlee Kine_

Act Three
Contributor David Rakoff visits his dream job: In the crafts department at Martha Stewart Living magazine. If his hobby became his job, he wonders, would it still be fun? (11 minutes) _David Rakoff_

      <description>In the wake of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, a collection of stories in which people try to make sense of loss.

Prologue
Reporter Mark Arax spent three years investigating the murder of his father and yet he's still not at peace when he thinks of his dad's death. (His book is called In My Father's Name .) This is how it goes sometimes: We create a story that tries to explain our lives, and it still leaves so much unanswered. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Genevieve Jurgensen and her husband Laurent lost their two daughters—Elise and Mathilde—at the ages of 4 and 7. Actress Felicity Jones reads from her book The Disappearance: A Memoir of Loss , in which Jurgensen tries to explain their lives and their deaths to a friend, in a series of letters. (28 minutes) _Felicity Jones, Genevieve Jurgensen_

Act Two
A father and daughter (Adrian LeBlanc and his daughter Adrian Le Blanc) decide to write his obituary—together—not really thinking very seriously at first about the real meaning of what they were doing. (11 minutes) _Adrian Nicole LeBlanc_

Act Three
How writer (and frequent This American Life contributor) David Sedaris and his family reacted when Sedaris's mother—a lifelong, unrepentant smoker—developed lung cancer. After a lifetime of barbed, funny remarks, no one in the family is prepared to talk about their feelings. (11 minutes) _David Sedaris_

      <description>Stories in the wake of the events of September 11, 2001.

Prologue
Ira talks with two New Yorkers on their reactions to seeing something they could never have believed possible. They acted in ways that they never had before, just ran around and around in circles. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Lynn Simpson worked on the 89th floor of the World Trade Center. She escaped, along with the rest of her office, and now is trying to figure out what it means that she's alive, and how her life is different now. (15 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
David Rakoff tells the story of the day that used to hold the record as the worst disaster in New York history: June 15th, 1904, when the steamship The General Slocum, caught fire and sank in the Hudson river, killing 1,031 passengers. Almost everyone aboard was from one neighborhood in New York, and by all accounts, that neighborhood was never the same again. (9 minutes) _David Rakoff_

Act Three
In our search for events that might illuminate what we've seen in New York this week, we hear interviews with survivors of a terrorist attack that happened in a crowded city, during rush hour, just six years ago. On March 20, 1995, the Aum cult dropped plastic bags of poison gas on the Tokyo subway. Haruki Murakami interviewed dozens of survivors about what happened, and how they got on with their lives afterwards. The English edition of the book of interviews is called Underground: the Tokyo Gas Attack and the Japanese Psyche , and he gave us permission to read portions of it here. (12 minutes) _Haruki Murakami_

Act Four
David Sedaris talks about American and French reaction to the recent news in Paris, where he lives. He's the author of Me Talk Pretty One Day and other books. (6 minutes) _David Sedaris_

Act Five
Ira talks with Chicago Public Radio reporter Shirley Jahad about white Chicagoans and Arab-American Chicagoans facing off, each side waving American flags and shouting "U.S.A."...and how each means very different things when they do it. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>In September 2001, we tried to sort out what the war in Afghanistan would be like, and what our lives would be like during this war.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass explains that if we're going to war—as the President keeps promising—it's hard to understand what's in store for us. Today's show is an attempt to figure that out. (1 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
For a few days after the attacks on September 11th, it seemed like we were just on the verge of bombing and retaliation. But two weeks went by, and no military action had begun. To help sort out exactly what we knew at this point about what the war would be like, Ira talks with NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Gjelten. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
One way to understand what war will be like is to understand what past wars were like. Andrew Carroll recently started something called the Legacy Project, which collects letters Americans wrote home during wartime, from the Civil War up through the conflicts in the Persian Gulf and Bosnia. It's over 50,000 letters, a portion of which he assembled into a book titled War Letters. We also hear from Estelle Lynch, who received over 500 letters from her fiance Sid Diamond during World War II. (14 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
An excerpt from a story that writer Lee Sandlin wrote for the Chicago Reader about what it is that makes wartime different and about the particular psychology of being at war. It was a massive historical article, exhaustively researched. Sandlin was interested in World War II—in why it'd been forgotten—and in what exactly had been forgotten. Actor Matt Malloy reads. Sandlin's article appeared in the Chicago Reader in March 1997, in two parts. Contact them for more information on getting a copy. (13 minutes) _Matt Malloy, Lee Sandlin_

Act Four
Scott Carrier drove 2,000 miles across the country from his home in Salt Lake City to Chicago, talking with people about the coming war. If it's part of the American character to be profoundly skeptical, and another part to be boldly patriotic...Scott found both tendencies...often in the same person. (21 minutes) _Scott Carrier_

      <description>In the movieRashomon, one story is told from four different points of view. The story changes dramatically depending on who's telling it. This week, the events of September 11th, and how their meaning changes depending on who you talk to.

Prologue
Larry Keeley explains why the Pentagon wants to see things from another perspective...and how hard that is to do. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Producer Julie Snyder reports on a Palestinian teenager from Chicago who explains why everything you think you know about the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks is wrong. (17 minutes) _Julie Snyder_

Act Two
We hear the story of the Persian Gulf war, as told by Issam Shukri, a family man from Bagdad who was drafted into Saddam's army against his will. He had to explain to his three-year-old son why those usually civilized Americans were bombing their city night after night. (14 minutes) _Issam Shukri_

Act Three
U.S. special operations forces will lead the first part of the coming war we're all bracing for. We hear how a simple half-hour mission turned into a bloody all-day battle in one of the last times special operations forces went out: in 1993, in Somalia. Alex Blumberg interviews Mark Bowden, author of Black Hawk Down , an account of the battle. (17 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

      <description>There's the time when you know something is happening, but you're not sure exactly what. The illness before it's diagnosed. The era, before it's been given a title. And something changes when the name is given. Stories of that transformation...between what it is now, and what it was before it had a name.

Prologue
Rod Hudson grew up on a dairy farm in New Hampshire. When his father retired, Rod ran his own operation on his dad's property and did just fine until the mid 1980's when something strange started to happen with the cows. A series of strange things started to happen actually, beginning with their hooves. (6 minutes)

Act One
In 1946, a man named David Boder started to investigate the Holocaust before it was known as the Holocaust. He dragged a primitive recording device around Europe and gathered the first recorded testimonials of concentration camp survivors. But his research was largely ignored, and his recordings forgotten for decades. The tapes are broadcast for the first time nationally on tonight's show. Carl Marziali tells the story.. Listen to Boder's recordings, or read transcripts, at their official home on the web. (31 minutes) _Ira Glass, Carl Marziali_

Act Two
A short story about the moment when we suddenly learn the name of something that has heretofore been unnamed for us...and about the difference between knowing the person, and knowing the person's name. Heather O'Neill is the author of Two Eyes Are You Sleeping , a book of poetry. (6 minutes) _Heather O'Neill_

Act Three
The story about what happens when you discover the medical reason your mother was such a bad parent all your life. Laura Tangusso tells the story of how she and her siblings learned the name of something they'd always wondered: What was wrong with their mother? (14 minutes) _Laura Tangusso_

Act Four
There is that moment when you're falling for someone, before either of you says the word love...but when you both FEEL it. But then once the word love is applied to a feeling...is it possible we're all actually referring to different feelings? Jonathan Goldstein tells a story about what if the word love didn't exist. He's the author of the novels, Lenny Bruce is Dead and Ladies and Gentlemen, The Bible! . (5 minutes) _Jonathan Goldstein_

      <description>People climbing to be number one. How do they do it? What is the fundamental difference between us and them?

Prologue
Ira Glass talks with Paul Feig, who, as a sixth-grader, read the Dale Carnegie classic How to Win Friends and Influence People at the urging of his father. He found that afterward, he had a bleaker understanding of human nature—and even fewer friends than when he started. (9 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
David Sedaris has this instructive tale of how, as a boy, with the help of his dad, he tried to bridge the chasm that divides the popular kid from the unpopular — with the sorts of results that perhaps you might anticipate. (14 minutes) _David Sedaris_

Act Two
After the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, U.S. diplomats had to start working the phones to assemble a coalition of nations to combat this new threat. Some of the calls, you get the feeling, were not the easiest to make. Writer and performer Tami Sagher imagines what those calls were like. (6 minutes) _Tami Sagher_

Act Three
To prove this simple point—a familiar one to readers of any women's magazines—we have this true story of moral instruction, told by Luke Burbank in Seattle, about a guy he met on a plane dressed in a hand-sewn Superman costume. (13 minutes) _Luke Burbank_

Act Four
Jonathan Goldstein with a story about what it's like to date Lois Lane when she's on the rebound from Superman. Jonathan Goldstein is the host of the podcast Heavyweight . (13 minutes) _Jonathan Goldstein_

      <description>The true story of an abandoned house, discovered by a young boy in the 1970s, and the mysterious family who disappeared without a trace.

Prologue
Ira introduces this week's story. (1 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Adam Beckman tells the first part of his story, about how, back in the 70s, he and his friends broke into an abandoned  house in the small town of  Freedom, New Hampshire. The home turned out to be a perfect time capsule, containing the furniture, letters and personal effects of an entire family — abandoned for decades. It seemed like the family just vanished one day, leaving salt and pepper shakers on the table, notes on the bedroom mirror, and a wallet with money still inside. Adam and his friends read the letters, saving some as clues, and never forgot. (30 minutes.) _Adam Beckman_

Act Two
Adam Beckman continues his story. He returns to the town in New Hampshire where he discovered the abandoned house as a kid and tries to find out what happened there. It turns out he's not the only one looking for an answer to that question. (25 minutes) _Adam Beckman_

      <description>Of all the wars to win, perhaps the propaganda war is the hardest. In this show, we bring you stories of propaganda wars past and present, by those who fought them and those who survived them.

Prologue
We hear clips from the recent press conference with Charlotte Beers, recently appointed Undersecretary of Public Diplomacy. Part of her job is, in her words, to sell the "brand America" abroad. To consider all the difficulties she might face in certain parts of the world, host Ira Glass talks with Zdenka Milanovich, who ran the marketing campaign for Ariel laundry detergent, the European equivalent of Tide, in Pakistan. He also talks with John Quelch, a marketing expert from Harvard. (9 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
The story of a clandestine radio station the CIA set up back in the good old, bad old days of the 1950s, to overthrow Guatemala. The coup succeeded because of the immense power of radio. Or that's what the CIA believed, anyway. We play the recently declassified tapes of the station's broadcasts. We believe it's the first time they've ever been broadcast in this country. Nancy Updike reports. (25 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Two
A story of wartime, of altruism and self-interest, of believing one's own publicity, and of a 50-year campaign for hearts and minds that was better known as the Bob Hope USO tour. Reporter Margy Rochlin saw one of the tours with her own eyes, in Tahiti in the 1980s, and has audio tapes to prove it. (23 minutes) _Margy Rochlin_

      <description>In a time of war, when we're all feeling a heightened sense of "us" and "them," we wanted to take up the problem of "them." Some people need a good "them." Other people tend to see all "thems" as more like us. And so we bring you three stories of people misperceiving the them-miness of them.

Prologue
Ira talks with students from rival high schools, Glenbrook North and Glenbrook South. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Several years ago, before most of us paid much attention to the name Osama bin Laden, Reporter Jon Ronson spent a year following around a Muslim activist named Omar Bakri, who called himself bin Laden's "man in London." At first Ronson thought Bakri was on the "them" side of "us and them." But then Ronson got to know him, and changed his mind. After September 11th, he had to change his mind again. Ronson tells his story, which includes excerpts from his book Them: Adventures with Extremists . (20 minutes) _Jon Ronson_

Act Two
David Sedaris reads a new story about what "they" do at Christmas. And by "they" of course, we mean the Dutch. (7 minutes) _David Sedaris_

Act Three
Reporter Chris Brookes had always thought the story was a joke: During World War II, a black sailor from the U.S. washed up nearly dead onshore in Newfoundland, and the white nurses—never having seen a black man—thought he was covered in oil and tried to scrub him clean. But when Brookes finally tracked the sailor down, decades later, it turned the whole thing was true. And the sailor said that sort of treatment was a lot nicer than what he'd been used to at the hands of whites down south. Brookes tells the incredible story of the sailor, Lanier Phillips, and how his experience in Newfoundland changed his life. (23 minutes) _Chris Brookes_

      <description>Stories of faith: losing it, talking about it, constructing it, and working within it.

Prologue
A story of faith lost, thanks to a book about extraterrestrials and a Rabbi. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
An explanation of what Christians and Muslims talk about in a place you might not expect them to get along at all: Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. Host Ira Glass talks with Georg Taubmann, a relief worker with the Christian missionary group Shelter Now, who built houses and did other good works in Afghanistan for seventeen years, until he was arrested by the Taliban in August. He was rescued in November. He says that it's actually easier to talk religion with the Afghans than it is in the U.S. or in Taubmann's home country of Germany. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Josh Noel reports with Alex Blumberg from Groom, Texas, 45 minutes east of Amarillo, on the largest cross in the Western hemisphere—it's 19 stories tall—the man who built it, and the people who stop at the cross to pray. (18 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

Act Three
Bill Lychak reports on what it's like to be a factory worker in the Epiphany Plant, bringing news of miracles to Christians in a magazine called Guideposts . It's a good job, he says. His account first appeared on Open Letters . (8 minutes) _Bill Lychak_

Act Four
Susie Putz-Drury reports on Bethel Church in Dandridge, Tennessee. It's an all-black Presbyterian Church with a white pastor, who does not always agree with his own congregation on the best way to worship God. They yearn for more spirit, more charisma. He says if emotion is all you get from church, you're not getting enough. Susie explains how he's stayed there fifteen years. (16 minutes) _Susan Drury_

      <description>Personal recordings one person made for just one other person, including what some have called the greatest phone message ever.

Prologue
We hear a tape that a man named David Cossin made for a woman in Italy named Allesandra whom he'd met during a week he spent there, and with whom he'd fallen in love. He sent her a dozen tapes, including one where he tries to convince her to move to New York and be with him. Ira explains that hearing this tape - made by one person for one other - is different than other things you hear on the radio. Most radio stories are for an audience of many. This week, an audience of many listens in on tapes intended for an audience of one. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Jonathan Goldstein with a story about friendship, mothers and sons, and what some have called the greatest phone message in the world. Jonathan is the host of the podcast Heavyweight . (19 minutes) _Jonathan Goldstein_

Act Two
Kevin Murphy is a college student in Idaho who stutters. Using the power of radio editing, he and the production staff of This American Life removed his pauses, stutters and repeats so that he could record a message the way it seems the rest of the world would like to hear him sound. His recording is for one person...a pizza guy, in Idaho. (6 minutes) _Kevin Murphy_

Act Three
During the first Gulf War, John Brasfield was an army scout. He went on dangerous missions, in which he was exposed often to enemy fire with little protection. On most missions, he took along a cassette recorder and taped the action for his wife.  He did it so that if something did happen to him, she'd at least know the circumstances. At one point he recorded, by accident, what may have been the unnecessary killling of Iraqi soldiers who'd already surrendered. (18 minutes) _John Brasfield_

Act Four
David Cossin's and Allesandra Pomarico's story from the prologue continues. We hear more of David's tapes, and they both tell us how successful the tapes were. (10 minutes) _David Cossin_

      <description>The story of how the American Psychiatric Association decided in 1973 that homosexuality was no longer a mental illness.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass explains that the show this week consists of one long story, the story of something very small that was part of something very large in the history of our country. (2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
In 1973, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) declared that homosexuality was not a disease simply by changing the 81-word definition of sexual deviance in its own reference manual. It was a change that attracted a lot of attention at the time, but the story of what led up to that change is one that we hear today, from reporter Alix Spiegel. Part one of Alix's story details the activities of a closeted group of gay psychiatrists within the APA who met in secret and called themselves the GAYPA...and another, even more secret group of gay psychiatrists among the political echelons of the APA. Alix's own grandfather was among these psychiatrists, and the president-elect of the APA at the time of the change. Alix is the co-host of NPR’s Invisibilia . (24 minutes) _Alix Spiegel_

Act Two
Alix Spiegel's story continues, with a man dressed in a Nixon mask called Dr. Anonymous, and a pivotal encounter in a Hawaiian bar. Funding for Alix Spiegel's story came from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. (30 minutes) _Alix Spiegel_

Cuervo Man was wearing nothing but a Speedo, wraparound shades, and a red cape. Occasionally he’d stick a toilet plunger on his bald head. John was fascinated and eventually got to know Cuervo Man, whose real name was Ryan. Though the Cuervo act was Ryan’s Plan B, it had a special power that John couldn't help but envy. John Hodgman is the host of the Judge John Hodgman podcast. (19 minutes) _John Hodgman_

Prologue

      <description>Two stories that are worst case scenarios for any parent. In each story, when you take apart what happened and how it happened, it's hard to see how anyone could've prevented things from going bad.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass plays tape from the documentary TV series American High of a teenager fighting with his parents about which car he can take out that night. Every family has its own way of fighting and its own particular family dynamic, and if things go terribly bad, it's often hard to figure how the bad things could've been prevented. (1 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
The chronicle of a family that unravelled. Debra Gwartney loved her two oldest daughters like she loved herself. And they loved her in return. But Debra got a divorce, moved the family to Oregon, and relations with her daughters got worse and worse. Finally, at the ages of thirteen and fourteen, they ran away. In this story, Debra and her daughters try and retrace what exactly went wrong. The story was produced by Sandy Tolan of Homelands Productions, in collaboration with Debra Gwartney and her daughters. It's part of the World Views series of first person narratives, which gets funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Debra wrote a book about what happened in their family called Live Through This: A Mother's Memoir of Runaway Daughters and Reclaimed Love . (35 minutes) _Debra Gwartney_

Act Two
Brent Runyon tells the story of the day in eighth grade that he set himself on fire...and what led to that. He wasn't a loner, he had friends, his mother was a teacher, his parents took an interest in his life. This is an excerpt from his memoir, called The Burn Journals . (18 minutes) _Brent Runyon_

      <description>After a decade in which DNA evidence has freed over 100 people nationwide, it's become clear that DNA evidence isn't just proving wrongdoing by criminals, it's proving wrongdoing by police and prosecutors. In this show, we look at what DNA has revealed to us: how police get innocent people to confess to crimes they didn't commit and how they get witnesses to pin crimes on innocent people.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass surveys the effects DNA has had on the criminal justice landscape. He talks with Huy Dao, at the Innocence Project , where they are waist-deep in 2,000 letters from prisoners claiming DNA can prove them innocent. Charlotte Word at Cellmark Diagnostics, the largest and oldest private DNA forensics lab in the country, explains how their caseload is expanding into all sorts of new areas like insurance claims and medical malpractice suits. John Stanton, a detective in Arlington, Texas, recently opened up over 49 old unsolved cases, to see if DNA might be successful where old methods weren't. One case he reopened: The very first case he went on himself as a young crime scene officer in 1985. And finally, Chicago Tribune investigative reporter Maurice Possley explains that DNA has shed so much doubt on the criminal justice system in Illinois that now prosecutors and judges are reopening questionable cases that don't even have DNA evidence. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
This is the story of some teenagers who were wrongfully convicted of murder and served 15 years in prison. DNA set them free, then convicted the two men who really did the crime. Shane DuBow reports on how the police framed them with the crime in the first place, and what it's like to be in prison when you know you're innocent. (37 minutes) _Shane DuBow_

Act Two
The story of how common and perfectly legal police interrogation procedures, procedures without violence or torture, were able to get an average fourteen-year-old suburban kid to confess to murdering his own sister...even though DNA evidence later proved that he hadn't done the crime. (12 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>Stories about what happens when you name names. When you turn someone over to the authorities, it can set into motion lots of huge, unintended consequences. A reporter turns over an interviewee to the FBI. A group of teachers turn in their principal. A director turns in his Communist colleagues to the United States Congress.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass explains that when you name names, when you whistleblow, when you tell on someone, you often do it anonymously. We hear from one anonymous squealer, who was done wrong by her doctor—he messed up a procedure and then refused to fix it. She decided to get even with him by turning him in to the IRS. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Reporter Jon Ronson tells the story of how, in the immediate wake of September 11, he became convinced that a man he'd done a story on was responsible for the Anthrax attacks in America. So he did something he'd never done before, he ratted out his source to the FBI. He then felt the guilt of accusing someone who turns out not to be guilty. Jon Ronson is the author of the book, Them: Adventures with Extremists . (18 minutes) _Jon Ronson_

Act Two
We hear excerpts from two autobiographies which each describe the same moment, but in very different ways. Elia Kazan and Arthur Miller agree that they met with each other in 1952, around the time Kazan named the names of his old friends to the House Committee on Un-American Activities. But they don't agree on what the conversation was like. Kazan describes it in his memoir, A Life , as cordial, supportive. Miller describes it in his Timebends as quietly calamitous. And after this moment, each man went on to defend his position in later work—Miller with The Crucible , about the dangers of bandwagon accusation; and Kazan with On The Waterfront , containing perhaps the single greatest testimony to squealing in the history of film. (11 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
Susan Drury tells the story of what happens when one of the most respected men in town gets accused of sexual harassment by one of the most trusted women in town. For a lot of the townspeople it was a difficult decision, but they chose to believe him over her. And some of them didn't change their minds, even when the man was later revealed to be a murderer. (21 minutes) _Susan Drury_

      <description>Stories about what happens when a new guy comes on the scene, and changes the way everyone who was already there relates to each other.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with Sarah Koenig, about the first and only time a movie star came over to her family's house when she was a kid, and how it didn't go too well, for the celebrity or for her. The movie star, Robert Redford, ended up stealing all her parents' attention, attention they usually lavished on Sarah, the youngest. On top of that, they were acting all nervous, and anxious, different than usual. It made young Sarah mad, and she ended up taking it out on poor Mr. Redford. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass, Sarah Koenig_

Act One
The story of what happens to an average American family, when a perfectly normal, rational and funny mom starts spending every day in the company of an ancient Buddhist monk named Aaron, who no one else can see. Davy Rothbart is one of her three sons, and also the reporter for this story. He goes back and to talk to his brothers and father and mother about something they've never actually discussed: Do any of them believe in Aaron? Davy is the man behind Found Magazine. (26 minutes) _Davy Rothbart_

Act Two
Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr. already had one other man in his life who shared his name—his world famous father, the Jesse Jackson. But then right before his most recent primary race, an aide told him that he now had another Jesse Jackson to contend with. This other Jesse Jackson, a retired truck driver with no political experience, had mysteriously appeared on the same voting ballot as congressman Jackson. Ira reports on whether this was all a strange coincidence or a bit of political mischief orchestrated by the Congressman's political rivals. (9 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
Jonathan Goldstein and Heather O'Neill tell the true story of what happens when a person tries to intrude on a idyllic family of two, one of whom loves him, one of whom does not. For the first few years Jonathan knew Heather, her daughter Arizona was not very fond of him. For a long time he was nineteenth on Arizona's list of favorite people—behind the neighbor's dog and the plumber. Jonathan Goldstein is the author of the book, Lenny Bruce is Dead . Heather O'Neill's is the author of Two Eyes Are You Sleeping , a book of poetry. (15 minutes) _Jonathan Goldstein, Heather O'Neill_

      <description>Stories of people who are trying to convince you that the Devil is there, whispering in your ear...and stories of people who try to deny he's there, against some very heavy evidence.

Prologue
How does the Devil work? We hear stories from five different people who say they found themselves inexplicably doing something random and bad, something which made no sense to them at all. Host Ira Glass explains why this might be, cadging a bit from C.S. Lewis's The Screwtape Letters . (11 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Trinity Church in Texas puts on something called Hell House every Halloween. It's like a haunted house, but each scene shows teenage church members acting out scenes of things the church considers sins. There's a homosexual dying of AIDS; a girl in an abortion clinic (on a doctor's table with fake blood splashed between her legs); a mom who leaves her family for someone she meets on the Internet. George Ratliff made a documentary about all this called Hell House . He plays some of his footage and talks about how effective it is, and how much of a thrill it is for the pious teenagers to act like sinners. (14 minutes) _George Ratliff_

Act Two
Faron Yoder lives in Amish country in Indiana. When he was a teenager, like every Amish sixteen-year-old, Faron was allowed to abandon the restrictions of Amish life and live as a regular American teenager. It's part of an Amish tradition called rumspringa, which lets Amish kids drive cars and drink and party for a few years, before they decide whether or not to be baptised into the Amish church and live an Amish life. Now 21, Faron explains to Ira why most Amish kids decide to stay Amish after rumspringa, and why, at 21, he hasn't. He's featured in a documentary called Devil's Playground, by filmmaker Lucy Walker. (9 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
The story of a man who committed a murder when he was a teenager. He got away with it, and didn't tell the police for twenty years. But then one day, for reasons that aren't entirely clear to him, he did. Reporter Sarah Koenig talked with him in prison, about what it's like to come clean after twenty years, but not even remember how or why. (21 minutes) _Sarah Koenig_

      <description>We take the stately laws of physics—laws which mathematicians and scientists have spent centuries discovering and verifying—and apply them to the realm of human relationships, to see if they shed useful light on our daily lives.

Prologue
We hear two stories of everyday life which are more easily understood if one knows some of the laws of physics, specifically the Mediocrity Principle and the Casimir Effect. Then particle physicist and Senior Editor David Kestenbaum explains why physicists hate it when non-scientists try to apply these laws and principles to their daily lives. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass, David Kestenbaum_

Act One
In Los Angeles, Cris Beam reports on a family named the Paladinos that had a theory that explained their lives. And then, at some point, that theory came to seem inadequate. It didn't seem to match the data and evidence at hand. So they switched to a different theory. Cris Beam’s latest book is I Feel You: The Surprising Power of Extreme Empathy . _Cris Beam_

Act Two
Jon Ronson tells the story of how his parents decided to commission a family portrait, and how things went awry because of the brilliant but troubled local artist they hired for the job. In the story, Jon circles in a reluctant orbit around his parents, and his parents are in a rather energetic orbit of their own. Jon’s new podcast series is Things Fell Apart: Eight Strange Tales from the Culture Wars . (13 minutes) _Jon Ronson_

Act Three
David Sedaris outlines an experiment he conducted with fluids and a tube and a bag. The result: The Stadium Pal. His story was recorded before a live audience by Seattle Arts and Lectures. (5 minutes) _David Sedaris_

      <description>Stories about people who turned to the experts and got horrible advice. One story is about people who went to therapists who made them sicker. Another is about how the hosts ofCar Talkinadvertently (or perhaps intentionally) destroyed a car belonging to one of their own employees.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with NPR's Car Talk hosts Tom and Ray Maggliozi and a former employee of theirs, Joe Richman. Ray once fixed Joe's beloved '72 Plymouth Valiant, a repair job which hastened it to its grave...but probably got Joe a girlfriend. Tom and Ray discuss how common it is for car experts to screw up a repair. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass, Tom and Ray Maggliozi_

Act One
Alix Spiegel reports on the "Recovered Memory" movement. In the early 1990s people across America turned to experts in psychology for help...and many people were told that the source of their problems could be traced to traumatic events they could not even remember, to memories that had to be recovered through special techniques. In the last ten years, this whole approach to psychology has fallen out of favor. So what happened that so many experts came to believe in a treatment that turned out to make many of their patients worse, not better...and what happened when the patients and therapists figured all this out? (37 minutes) _Alix Spiegel_

Act Two
Sure, those who can't do, teach. But what about those who can do? Marlon Brando has created a set of instructional videos about acting, called Lying for a Living. Reporter Jod Kaftan got a sneak preview. He says Brando clearly wants to do right by his students, but the qualities that make him a great actor make him a dreadful teacher. (13 minutes) _Jod Kaftan_

      <description>Stories of people who go to great lengths to give people what they want, and how they're rewarded sometimes, misguided other times.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass goes to a fake wedding at a home for Alzheimer's patients in Davenport, Iowa. Two high school kids who've never even kissed are the bride and groom. Most of the residents couldn't tell you either of their names. But the staff of the Country House residence stages the event because it makes the residents happy...even if they won't remember it by dinnertime. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
The story from the prologue continues, with the groom who refused to be a groom, and the one person who'll probably remember the fake wedding, namely, the fake bride. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
A fable of how America got its name, and how it was named after someone who was a fraud, but the kind of fraud people love, the kind of fraud who knows how to please a crowd. Jack Hitt tells the racy and little-known story of how Amerigo Vespucci got his name all over the map of the western hemisphere by telling lies about what he found there—the type of lies which can be found today in the pages of Penthouse magazine. (13 minutes) _Jack Hitt_

Act Three
Milton Reid works as a freelance muralist in one of the largest housing projects in America, Chicago's Robert Taylor Homes. For fifty to two hundred dollars, he'll paint a mural on a resident's living room wall, or in their kitchen, or in the bathroom. He explains that when he first started, all his clients wanted were black and gold panthers, but their tastes have gotten more varied. (8 minutes) _Amy Dorn_

Act Four
Ali Davis literally hands people their fantasies, in her job at a Chicago video store with a huge porn section. She tells true stories about what the job is like. (10 minutes) _Ali Davis_

Act Five
In any family, giving other people what they want becomes fantastically complicated, often because people tend to give others the things they'd like themselves. Curtis Sittenfeld explains how the drama plays out in her family, when it comes to her father's weight. Recently her dad signed up with a woman known as "The Diet Nazi." (16 minutes) _Curtis Sittenfeld_

      <description>It's been two years since the Mideast peace process collapsed, two years in which each side has done terrible things to the other side. We wanted to understand what that has done to people living in Israel and the West Bank, and to see if anyone is feeling hope.

Prologue
Ira visits the border where Israel meets the West Bank and finds it's more like Scottsdale, Arizona, than he ever expected. We also hear from Tel Aviv advertising writer Erez Hadary, who created a bumper sticker that expresses Israeli confusion right now; from Rula Hamadani, a Palestinian who's feeling just as confused; and from journalist and historian Tom Segev (author of 1949: The First Israelis , Elvis in Jerusalem , and other books) about some very odd Israeli poll numbers. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Nancy Updike reports that life under curfew in Ramallah can be, among other things, intensely boring. She also tells the story of Sam Bahour, a Palestinian who was born and raised in Ohio, who came back to the West Bank in 1995, when peace seemed possible, to help build the Palestinian state. Now he can't leave his house. (13 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Two
Ira Glass travels through Israel with Adam Davidson, who speaks Hebrew and has countless Israeli cousins and other family members. They find that the entire country has moved to the right in reaction to Palestinian violence. (26 minutes) _Adam Davidson, Ira Glass_

Act Three
What if a new Palestinian leader came on the scene who was neither part of the corrupt autocracy of the Palestinian Authority, nor part of fundamentalist, suicide-bombing Hamas? Nancy Updike follows around possible future Palestinian political candidate Mustafa Barghouti, a doctor who's well known for setting up clinics. All of Nancy Updike's radio work is supported with a grant from Hearing Voices , with funds from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting . (13 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

      <description>A group of inmates at a high-security prison rehearse and stage a production of the last act—Act V—ofHamlet.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass surveys various productions of Hamlet being staged around the country: At community colleges in Brooklyn and Honolulu, on a professional stage in Boston, and at a Shakespeare camp for kids in San Francisco—where all the scenes are death scenes. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Jack Hitt begins his story about a group of prisoners at the Missouri Eastern Correctional Center who are rehearsing and staging a production of Hamlet . The man who plays Hamlet gets in character by recalling times he's wanted to hurt people, like the crime that sent him to prison, in which he shot two people and left them for dead. Big Hutch, who plays Horatio, explains how it would work if you set Hamlet in a prison, and why it would actually improve a flaw in the plot. You can see video clips of the Prison Performing Arts performances online. (30 minutes) _Jack Hitt_

Act Two
Jack Hitt's story about a prison production of Hamlet continues. He discovers that almost all the actors draw on their pasts in one way or another to get into character. And some of them have committed crimes even worse than Jack had imagined. (22 minutes) _Jack Hitt_

      <description>Stories of innocent people fleeing from dangerous men in cars who shoot at them. Unlike in the movies, the pursuers aren't foreign agents or rogue CIA agents, but drunk off-duty policemen and small-town teenagers. Real-ife high-speed chases: who gets chased...and who does the chasing.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks to Cory Simmons and Dominique Mapp, who were driving home one night and were followed by a group of rowdy men in an SUV. The men tailed them for miles and then started firing a gun at them. When Cory and Dominique finally made it to a police station, it turned out that the men in the car were all drunk, white, off-duty policemen. Cory and Dominique are black. When the case came to trial, the cops weren't convicted of anything—not assault, not attempted murder, not even disorderly conduct. (9 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Reporter Susan Burton tells the story of a high-speed chase in South Dakota. An incident at a high school basketball game escalated to the point where a group of Native American girls from one town found themselves being chased down the highway by a group of white boys from another town. The boys were brandishing a shotgun and firing it into the air. What happened in the months that followed after police got involved and charges were filed didn't seem fair to either side. Susan begins the story by talking about the incident with the girls. For Native Americans, the event fit into what they see as a decades-long—or maybe centuries-long—pattern of injustice. And the event traumatized the girls so much that in the months after, one of them underwent an almost complete personality transformation, and another became suicidal. (22 minutes) _Susan Burton_

Act Two
Susan Burton's story continues. She investigates the effect the high-speed chase had in the town where it happened—Miller, South Dakota, one of the top ten most racially homogeneous places in the country. For most people in the town, the event was embarrassing and horrifying, but they were quick to excuse the boys, and they didn't understand why Native Americans might see it as anything other than an isolated incident. (22 minutes) _Susan Burton_

      <description>Stories of people getting more testosterone and coming to regret it. And of people losing it and coming to appreciate life without it. The pros and cons of the hormone of desire. And we get our testosterone measured, as a staff.

Prologue
Producer Alex Blumberg explains that he wanted to do this show because of his conflicted relationship with his own testosterone. He tells host Ira Glass that the reasons go back to a girl in his eighth-grade homeroom and the 1970s seminal feminist novel The Women's Room. We also hear from a man who stopped producing testosterone due to a medical treatment and found that his entire personality was altered. (9 minutes) _Alex Blumberg, Ira Glass_

Act One
The interview with a man who lost his testosterone continues. He explains that life without testosterone is life without desire—desire for everything: food, conversation, even TV. And he says life without desire is unexpectedly pleasant. The man first wrote about his experiences, anonymously, in GQ Magazine. (8 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
An interview with a transgender man, who started life as female and began taking testosterone injections several years ago. He explains how testosterone changed his views on nature vs. nurture for good. (17 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
The men and women on staff at This American Life decide to get their testosterone levels tested, to see who has the most and least, and to see if personality traits actually do match up with hormone levels. It turns out to be an exercise that in retrospect, we might not recommend to other close-knit groups of friends or co-workers. (12 minutes) _Ira Glass, David Rakoff_

Act Four
Novelist Miriam Toews, author of The X Letters (which appeared in an earlier episode of the show), tells the story of a road trip she took with her 15-year-old son. Her most recent book is called All My Puny Sorrows . (11 minutes) _Miriam Toews_

      <description>Stories of people traveling under fake papers, false identities, not for power or personal gain, but for their own deeper personal reasons.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with Erin Einhorn, a reporter for the Philadelphia Daily News , who went to Poland to find the Catholic family that had sheltered and saved her mother from the Nazi concentration camps during World War II. She found that in Krakow where she was living, in a country where Jewish populations had been vilified and then exterminated by the Nazis, Judaism was suddenly trendy. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Ira's conversation with Erin Einhorn continues. She talks about the possible reasons that, 50 years after Auschwitz, 10,000 Polish hipsters will now show up to see a Klezmer music concert. (17 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
A short story by Jhumpa Lahiri, from her book of short stories The Interpreter of Maladies . The story is read by Mira Nair, director of the movies Mississippi Masala , Monsoon Wedding , and others. (28 minutes) _Jhumpa Lahiri, Mira Nair_

Act Three
A story from David Sedaris about how the movie The End of the Affair almost ended his relationship. He argues that being in love sometimes means not saying what's going through your head. (5 minutes) _David Sedaris_

      <description>Some people have a rather dark worldview that divides people into two groups: Suckers and non-suckers. We hear their stories.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with Adam and Wendy, a couple whose world view was changed when they bought a house. Adam and Wendy were the kind of people who believed that most people by and large were good, and their motives by and large honest. But when they found that the former owner had lied about all sorts of things in their new house, they were reluctantly forced to change their view of things. The former owners were the types who believed in suckering the other guy before he suckers you, and now Adam and Wendy were starting to think that way too. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Jen's mom Sheila does things like this: She buys a brand name at a discount store, and then returns it to a fancy store for a full refund. She thinks you're a sucker if you don't take advantage of opportunities like that. Jen admires her mom's chutzpah, but can't do the things she does, so her mom tries to teach her...on tape. Jen pins a hidden microphone on herself, and she and her mother try and return a gift Burberry sweater to the actual Burberry store. (15 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Rarely when we're suckered do we get a chance at revenge, and that turns out to be a good thing. Writer Shane DuBow tells the story of a scam he fell for when he was just out of college. Twelve years later, the same guys tried the same scam on him. But getting even wasn't as easy as he thought. (11 minutes) _Shane DuBow_

Act Three
There's a whole nation where the idea of suckerdom permeates almost every aspect of culture and politics. Adam Davidson reports on the Israeli word "freier," which literally translates as sucker, but means much, much more. (7 minutes) _Adam Davidson_

Act Four
Writer Heather O'Neill tells the story of how she became a foster mother at 18—to a 16 year-old. (14 minutes) _Heather O'Neill_

      <description>In this show we take the classifieds from one Sunday edition of theChicago Sun-Timesand one edition of the local alternative weeklyChicago Reader, and fill a program with stories that come from the ads. Through the jobs offered, the missed connections, the crap that people sell each other and the musicians' ads we get a portrait of a whole city.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with Marion Tanios, a classified section editor at the Chicago Sun-Times . She explains that if the news section of the newspaper gives you the public life of a city, the classified section gives you a sense of people's personal lives. We take a quick tour through the classified section: "Wedding Dress for sale, never worn;" "Agoraphobics in Motion, A.I.M. meet weekly;" and a house sale where an old woman heading to a nursing home is selling off her belongings. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
"Stolen Dog, black, toy poodle named Isis." Producer Todd Bachmann interviews a man named Leo, who recently placed that ad. Leo was planning to breed Isis with his other dog, Button, a Shitzu, and make a new breed which he planned to call "Shidoodle." (7 minutes) _Todd Bachmann_

Act Two
An audio diary of two people using the classified ads to find jobs. Produced by Joe Richman, the awarding winning producer of the series Radio Diaries . (8 minutes) _Joe Richman_

Act Three
Sometimes in the classified ads one person will be seeking something that another person will be offering. This is especially true of the musicians section of the classifieds, where there might be a drummer seeking a band, and on the same page, a band seeking a drummer. We play matchmaker and form a one-day band out of the musicians in the classifieds. Producer Starlee Kine tells what happens, with the help of Jon Langford, a musician who already has a band, the Mekons, who are celebrating their 25th anniversary in rock and roll, and whose most recent album is OOOH! (Out of Our Heads) . (15 minutes) _Starlee Kine_

Act Four
"Joyce, I don't need another Housekeeper." Producer Jonathan Goldstein talks with the man who placed this ad. Joyce is the woman who left him. The ad is his attempt to win her back. (4 minutes) _Jonathan Goldstein_

Act Five
The classifieds are populated by people in flux. People selling stuff from old lives in transition new ones. But people buying the stuff may also be in transition. And they don't care if they're purchasing things with a history, just so long as it's someone else's history. Radio producer Jay Allison tells the story of the things he bought from the classifieds to fill his new life after his marriage broke up. Jay Allison receives funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting through the Open Studio Project. (15 minutes) _Jay Allison_

      <description>In this week's show, we celebrate the oft-beleaguered and misrepresented middleman. "Cut out the middleman! Death to the middleman!" the angry hordes cry. Not us. We say, "Hi, middleman. Here are three splendid acts to toast your subtle virtues."

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with Chris, who worked for a company that helped deaf people talk over the phone with hearing people. The deaf person would type what they wanted Chris to say, and Chris would say it, then type back the response from the hearing person on the line. As the man in the middle, Chris was privy to intimate moments in people's lives. He was the middleman on drug deals, breakups. Occasionally, desperate mothers would appeal to him directly to talk sense to their stubborn deaf children with words that they themselves did not possess. As the job wore on, Chris found it more and more impossible to just be a neutral go-between. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
You can't do a program about middlemen without a story about business. In this act, we hear from a man who made his living buying low and selling high...incredibly high, sometimes at mark-ups of up to 1,000 percent. In the 1990s, when Michael Jordan led the Bulls, "X" took to the streets of Chicago scalping tickets and making what he refers to nostalgically as "phat money." (20 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

Act Two
Sal Princiatta is a New York fireman whose unit lost a lot of men on September 11th. Beth Landau was a friend of Sal's, and a couple months ago, she orchestrated a trip to Memphis for Sal and the other guys at the firehouse. She thought it would take their minds off things. In Memphis, they were cheered and feted everywhere they went. People asked for autographs, gave them gifts. Sal realized that as New York fireman, he and his colleagues were acting as a very particular and unusual kind of middleman for the people they met. This story was put together with the help of Lumiere Productions in New York City. (9 minutes) _Beth Landau_

Act Three
Al Jurczynski is the mayor of Schenectady, New York. For the past year, he's embarked on a strange recruitment campaign, to convince Guyanese immigrants living in Queens, New York, to move upstate to Schenectady. He walks through the streets of New York City with a megaphone, inviting people to sign up for semi-monthly charter bus tours of his city, which he provides free of charge. Producer Wendy Dorr spends a day on the tour bus, to see how the mayor serves as middleman between Guyanese-American families in the Bronx and Queens, and his economically troubled, white-ethnic town upstate. (19 minutes) _Wendy Dorr_

      <description>Home movies are often all the same—kids on the beach, people getting married, birthday parties—so why do we make and watch so many of them? Maybe it's because the story they show and the story they tell are different. In this show, we bring you five stories that all start with a fairly typical home movie but go on to tell a unique story.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with filmmaker Alan Berliner, who for six years collected old home movies he found at thrift stores and garage sales. He says that almost all of them document either rites of passage, like birthdays and weddings, or moments of leisure—the beach is especially big. They show our lives as we'd want them to look, but maybe not as they actually do. Alan Berliner's movie, which he made from his six years of collected video, is called Family Album . (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Jonathan Goldstein made every girl he ever dated watch the home movie of his family's Rosh Hashanah dinner he made when he was 17. He hoped that seeing his family life on film might make the women more sympathetic to his shortcomings. In this story, for the first time, Jonathan shares the Rosh Hashanah video with a national audience. Jonathan's most recent book is I'll Seize the Day Tomorrow (13 minutes) _Jonathan Goldstein_

Act Two
From the time he was a little kid until the time he graduated high school, Darren Stein made movies with his father's video camera. The cast was composed of friends from his street, a suburban cul-de-sac in Encino, California. The sets were their various backyards. The production schedule was every day after school, and all day in the summer. They shot horror movies, action flicks, and even a musical called "I Have No Friends," which Darren wrote soon after being transferred to a new junior high school. Darren is now a real director in Hollywood. Ira talked with him and his frequent childhood leading man, Adam Schell, about what the movies meant to them as kids. Darren and Adam made a documentary about their childhood moviemaking called Put the Camera on Me . (12 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
The TV show America's Funniest Home Videos has an archive of over half-a-million video clips. Ira talks with Todd Thicke, the show's co-executive producer, and Trace Beaulieu and Mike Palleschi, two of the show's writers, about what all that footage tells them about Americans that the rest of us don't know. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Four
Home movies usually don't have much of a plot—one of the many ways they differ from Hollywood movies. But reporter Susan Burton has a lifetime of home movies, which together describe a very Hollywood plot, about how she remade herself from a friendless nerd into a popular girl. (12 minutes) _Susan Burton_

Act Five
David Sedaris tells a story about his mother who hated home movies, and how his brothers and sisters came to appreciate them. David's the author of several books, including When You Are Engulfed in Flames . (6 minutes) _David Sedaris_

      <description>Stories of people stuck in their own personal reruns—moments or episodes that they revisit over and over again.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with Starlee Kine, who loves TV reruns more than first-run shows. She explains that even if it's a show she hates— Caroline in the City for example—she'll watch the rerun. The simple fact that it's a rerun makes it, not better exactly, but comforting in a way first-run shows aren't. (6 minutes) _Starlee Kine_

Act One
Starlee Kine tells the story of a man more obsessed with reruns than even she is. Director Trent Harris made a movie called The Beaver Trilogy . It's an entire movie that's a rerun, based on a personal rerun that Trent found himself caught in. Starlee saw the movie, and tells the remarkable story of why it was made. (27 minutes) _Starlee Kine_

Act Two
Many couples eventually encounter this problem: One person in the couple trots out the same story over and over, and the other person has to just listen. But what do the stories we tell in front of our significant others mean, and what do the significant others really think of them? Ira talks to three couples about the stories they've each told and heard countless times, and why. One couple is John Hodgman and his wife Catherine Hodgman. Another couple is RadioLab co-host Robert Krulwich and his wife Tamar Krulwich. Robert and Tamar's story, which involves Jackie Kennedy Onassis, was also illustrated by Chris Ware and animated by John Kuramoto for our television show. (16 minutes) _John Hodgman, Robert Krulwich_

Act Three
Sarah Vowell identifies a phenomenon that's sort of a cultural rerun. It's an analogy that gets made over and over in different situations: people who often are not black, or women, or in any way involved with civil rights, comparing themselves to Rosa Parks. (7 minutes) _Sarah Vowell_

      <description>Stories about why we should go to war versus stories of why we shouldn't.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass tells the story of a report by the U.S. intelligence community back in October 2002 that declared that the likelihood of Saddam Hussein using weapons of massive destruction was very low for the "foreseeable future"...unless the U.S. were to launch a military attack on Iraq. In other words, the war to stop him from using weapons of mass destruction would probably cause the thing it was designed to prevent. Ira talks with Senator Bob Graham, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, who asked the intelligence community to do this risk assessment, and who was surprised it didn't have more effect on the public debate over the war. Before he and Ira get off the phone, the Senator asks Ira to please pose a few questions about the intelligence report to the Administration for him. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Ira speaks with Gordon Jondroe of the newly-created Department of Homeland Security, trying to get answers to Senator Graham's questions. It doesn't go so well. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
For an Iraqi perspective on the war, we hear from Iraqis who've just crossed over the border into Jordan. It's the only open border with Iraq and 150,000 Iraqis live in Amman. Reporter Adam Davidson talks with a soldier who'll probably fight in the war against the United States, a man who claims he was one of Saddam Hussein's bodyguards and knows locations of hidden chemical weapons in Iraq. (18 minutes) _Adam Davidson_

Act Three
It's possible that the most compelling arguments against the war with Iraq, and the most compelling arguments for the war with Iraq, are arguments you've never heard. Ira talks with journalist Nicholas Lemann from The New Yorker magazine about two ways of seeing the war:  The so-called Hawks' view, and the so-called Realists' view. His article about all this is called "The War on What?" Two of the Realists, Stephen Van Evera from M.I.T. and Stephen Walt of Harvard, lay out their surprising case against the war. Arguing a very persuasive case against them is Kenneth Pollack, of the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, who was a Persian Gulf military analyst for seven years at the CIA (including during the Persian Gulf War) and after that for the National Security Council under President Clinton. He wrote a book called The Threatening Storm: the Case for Invading Iraq. (19 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Four
While we all may have nagging fears about the war against terror or the war against Iraq, we all have a lot of other things on our minds. We hear 19 eighth-graders' letters to the President, as collected by their teacher, Britt Honeycutt, in rural North Carolina. They come from a website where people post letters to the President for the world to see. Hudson is the author of a book of short stories called Dear Mr. President . (7 minutes) _Gabe Hudson_

      <description>Two stories about love, and what people mean when they use the word love. Or, looked at differently, two modern-day reinterpretations of the Frog Prince story. One concerns a pretty man falling in love with an unlikely woman. And an unlikely woman falling in love with a pretty bird.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass explains how you can get away with anything if you claim you did it for love. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Veronica Chater explains the conflict in her house between her love for her pet macaw—a kind of parrot—and her love for her husband and three kids. The macaw wreaks a sort of low-level chaos in the house, because it wants Veronica all to itself. (10 minutes) _Veronica Chater_

Act Two
Another story of someone using the word love as they try to make sense of things. Russell Banks reads an edited version of his short story "Sarah Cole: A Type of Love Story," which appears in its full version in his collection The Angel on the Roof . (42 minutes) _Russell Banks_

      <description>Stories of some of the secrets our government keeps: of imprisonment, deportation, and spying, and how those secrets affect us.

Prologue
We hear a brief clip of host Ira Glass talking to John Podesta, who as chief of staff under President Clinton helped institute that administration's policy of declassifying as many documents possible. The Bush administration's philosophy is very different. Ira runs through a list of new secrets in the federal government. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
There are at least two American citizens being held without charges, unable to see lawyers, in military jails in the U.S. There may be more. Jack Hitt tried to find out everything he could about one of them: Jose Padilla, who will stay confined to a brig in South Carolina "until the end of the war," according to the White House. (17 minutes) _Jack Hitt_

Act Two
In the war on terror, the government is rounding up foreigners, checking their immigration status, and then, sometimes, deporting them. It won't give out their names. David Kestenbaum tried to find out everything that can be found out about who these new deportees are...and about what happened to them once they were seized and put on trial, in secret. To do this, he has to bypass the federal government (which won't say much about the deportees) and head overseas to talk with them firsthand. (18 minutes) _David Kestenbaum_

Act Three
For over two decades, there's been a secret court in the United States called the FISA court (short for Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act). Its job is to authorize wiretaps on possible foreign spies and foreign agents. In 24 years, it has never turned down a government request for a wiretap, as best as any outsider can tell—until this year. This past summer the court  issued an opinion that said Attorney General John Ashcroft and the Justice Department were going way too far in their zeal for wiretaps. It cited 75 cases in which the Justice Department tried to sneak around rules to protect Americans from surveillance. Blue Chevigny reports on attempts to loosen up the rules on who the government spies on here in the U.S., and on this first-ever glimpse inside this secret court. (15 minutes) _Blue Chevigny_

      <description>In January 2002, the President of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, spoke at Georgetown University. There he urged Afghan-Americans, especially young ones, to move back to Afghanistan.

Prologue
In January 2002-- not long after the Taliban were driven from power in Afghanistan-- he came to the United States, partly to be on hand for the State of the Union address last year. And while he was here, he spoke with an audience that was mostly Afghan-Americans at Georgetown University. And he said to them, in Pashto and then in English, come back. Come back to Afghanistan. He directed this especially to the young people. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
It's possible that the very first teenager to heed his invitation was Hyder Akbar, 17, from Concord, California. In the summer of 2002, he travelled with his father to live in their home country. As luck would have it, he met a radio producer named Susan Burton before he left, and she gave him a tape recorder to take along. This show is devoted to his extraordinary recordings. In Kabul, Akbar learns to use a Kalashnikov and spends his days with his one-eyed war-hero uncle. By the end of the summer his father is appointed the official spokesman for the new Afghan government, which gives him insider's access to everything important that happens in Kabul. He meets warlords and sees the President. Hours after a bomb explodes in a market, he walks through the bloody, glass-strewn marketplace. A year later, in the summer of 2003, Hyder returned to Afghanistan and recorded stories that are, if anything, even more amazing than the ones in this show. That show, Teenage Embed, Part Two , takes place in Kunar province, where Hyder's dad was appointed governor. Susan Burton produced Hyder's audio diaries for the radio. Funding for her story came from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. _Susan Burton_

      <description>Stories of people trying to save the world one person at a time, and stories of sudden truths delivered by complete strangers.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with Michael Beaumier, who runs the personals section of the Chicago Reader , and who functions as a kind of guardian angel for many of the singles who advertise in his paper. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
The story of one girl's mission to bring people together everywhere by eliminating small talk forever. This American Life producer Starlee Kine has been going around lecturing audiences on the subject. She encourages them to switch to a new system she's invented, called The Rundown. Recorded at The Little Gray Book Lectures at the Galapagos Art Space in New York City. Thanks to Sheila Heti and the Trampoline Hall Lecture Series. (6 minutes) _Starlee Kine_

Act Two
Jessica Riddle reports on how, as a teenager, she and her friends would pick up the phone and dial the letters of the name "Heather" and talk to the old man who'd pick up the phone. At first they'd just prank call him. But then it turned out to be much more. (18 minutes) _Jessica Riddle_

Act Three
An art history professor tries to talk with his fists. (9 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Four
Susan Drury reports from Tennessee on a test that provides sudden truth from a stranger. It's based on a science whose goals could not be grander—to aid in the fight between good and evil. It was invented by a guy named Robert Hartman, who was nominated for the Nobel Prize for his work back in the 1970s. What's most amazing about the test is how effective it is. Learn more about the personality test mentioned in the show, the Hartman Value Profile . Or, contact the testing company featured in our story, Axiometrics International . (16 minutes) _Susan Drury_

      <description>It's been said that truth is the first casualty of war. In this week's show, we try to get the real stories from three very different wars.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with a Lance Corporal from the Marines' Eighth Communication Battalion at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, about what his superiors told him about Iraq at his pre-deployment briefing to go overseas. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Anthony Swofford reads an excerpt from his memoir, Jarhead: A Marine's Chronicle of the Gulf War and Other Battles , about his experience fighting in the first Gulf War in 1991, as a Marine sniper. (20 minutes) _Anthony Swofford_

Act Two
For many years, Israeli citizens learned a sanitized version of what happened during their War of Independence in 1948. They learned that 700,000 Arabs fled the country on their own accord. But in the late 1980s, a group of Israeli historians gained access to most of the government documents from the war and started writing a truer, less flattering version of the story: That in some cases, the Palestinians were forced out, or scared away, and then not allowed to return. Ira discusses the real history and its impact on the Israeli public with some of the men who uncovered it: Benny Morris, author of The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem 1947-1949 , and Tom Segev, who wrote 1949: The First Israelis . He also talks to BZ Goldberg, one of the filmmakers behind the Emmy-winning documentary about Israeli and Palestinian kids, called Promises . (20 minutes)

Act Three
John Hodgman tries to tell the real version of a war movie that's already been written, filmed and released on DVD—Star Wars. Aside from contributing regularly to This American Life , John Hodgman hosts a monthly performance series in New York City called The Little Gray Book Lecture Series. (10 minutes) _John Hodgman_

      <description>People starting over—sometimes because they want to, other times because they have to.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks to Jorge Just, who thought he'd started over successfully. He'd moved to New York, found an apartment that everyone told him was a great deal, things were looking good. Then a reality television show visited his building. (8 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Molly FitzSimons tells the story of her father starting over. After 25 years in the same zip code, as an executive in the same company, he moved to Los Angeles and tried to start over in a new life with a new venture: A cable channel, with no people, no talking, no plots, but lots and lots of puppies. (15 minutes) _Molly FitzSimons_

Act Two
Mary Beth Kirchner documents one day in the life of a hustler named Joe, who wakes up every morning broke, hustles as much as $10,000 during the day and then loses most of it by the time he goes to bed. What it's like to start from scratch every day of your life. Some of the funding for this story came from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting's Radio Fund. (18 minutes) _Mary Beth Kirchner_

Act Three
Jonathan Goldstein reads a story about the first people to ever start from scratch, a couple named Adam and Eve. This story appears in Jonathan's book Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bible . Jonathan is the host of the podcast Heavyweight . (14 minutes) _Jonathan Goldstein_

      <description>Does talking about it really help? Stories where it does, and stories where it doesn't, including a man who tried to battle his fears by listing them. He ended up with a list 138 items long.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks to Neil Chesanow, co-author of Please Read This for Me , a self-help book that doesn't just give you general advice. It gives you actual scripts to use in various difficult situations: Pre-written speeches to deliver if you've fallen out of love with your boyfriend, say, or if you've decided you want to have a baby. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
This story wasn't originally made to broadcast on a radio show. It's a tape made by a guy named Jake Warga, who'd never put anything together for radio. He made it to give to his friend Brian, who wanted to kill himself. After Brian tried to overdose, Jake took him out to a park bench to talk, and brought along a recorder. Later, Jake decided to edit the conversation down and give it to Brian as a gift, hoping that if Brian heard what he was saying, if he heard how he sounded, it might stop him from trying again. To learn how to edit and mix the audio, Jake visited the website Transom.org , where his story first appeared . (24 minutes) _Jake Warga_

Act Two
Michael Bernard Loggins, a developmentally disabled man in his 50s, tried to battle his fears by listing them, and came up with a list 138 items long. With the help of an arts program, Creativity Explored, he published his list in two zines called Fears of Your Life and Fears of Your Life: A Whole New One . Actor Tom Wright reads excerpts. Excerpts from the zines have been published as part of a book, also called Fears of Your Life. (9 minutes) _Michael Bernard Loggins, Tom Wright_

Act Three
For months Bill and Liz have gone around New York City with a sign that says "Talk To Me." It works. In subways and bars, on the street or in office lobbies, people come up and talk to them about any old thing. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Four
Two stories of communication where the words really don't matter: Elizabeth Gilbert tells the story of the worst wedding toast she's ever heard of. This story first appeared on the former website Other People's Stories . Elizabeth Gilbert is the author of several books, including Big Magic. Jonathan Goldstein tells the story of a man who wants to get in touch, but the words really don't matter. Jonathan is the host of the Gimlet podcast Heavyweight .

      <description>Stories from the beginnings of the war in Iraq, and how it compares with wars in our country's past.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks to Anthony Swofford, a former marine sniper and author of the Gulf War memoir Jarhead . He explains what he's seeing when he watches this new war with Iraq on television. (6 minutes) _Anthony Swofford_

Act One
Issam Shukri is an Iraqi man living in Canada. He lived in Baghdad when it was bombed during the first gulf war. He talks with Ira about how scary it was when the ground started shaking and the streetlights suddenly blinked out, and how hard it was to explain to his three-year-old son. (12 minutes) _Issam Shukri_

Act Two
Tice Ridley is a first lieutenant in the Army. He's been sending regular emails from Kuwait City, where he's stationed, about what it's like to wait for the war to begin, and what it's like to actually fight it. Excerpts are read by actor Tom Wright. (7 minutes) _Tom Wright_

Act Three
What's French for French Fries? David Sedaris has been following the diplomatic fiascoes of the last few months from Paris, where he lives. Relations between France and the U.S. have been so horrible these days we asked him how it seemed from over there. He sent us this dispatch. (4 minutes) _David Sedaris_

Act Four
Sarah Vowell tells the story about the first time the United States attacked a country that hadn't attacked us first. It was also the first time the U.S. went to a foreign country to force a regime change. The country in question is still not doing too well a hundred years later. (8 minutes) _Sarah Vowell_

Act Five
A few years back, a writer named Lee Sandlin wrote a story for the weekly paper The Chicago Reader about what makes wartime different—how a country's perceptions and logic during war are fundamentally different than during peace. It was a massive historical article, exhaustively researched. He was interested partly in World War Two—specifically, in why it'd been forgotten and what it was that had been forgotten. Actor Matt Malloy reads an excerpt. (10 minutes) _Matt Malloy, Lee Sandlin_

Act Six
The story of a preventive act of war committed 3200 years ago, in the land that's now Turkey, not too far from Iraq. Seneca's The Trojan Woman takes place at the end of the Trojan war. MacArthur Genius Grant recipient Mary Zimmerman is directing the play at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago. She talks with Ira about the play. In it, a child is murdered to prevent a war, though no one's really sure that if the child lived he'd have actually waged war on his neighbors. A superpower nation preaches about the child. "His life itself is a danger we cannot allow to continue to undermine the entire region's collective security." (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>Stories from a contradictory recession.

Prologue
We try to figure out the paradox of the current economy, where more and more Americans are simultaneously both losing jobs and buying new homes and cars. Host Ira Glass talks to Ernest Istook, Republican Congressman from Oklahoma, who supports both a balanced budget amendment and President Bush's proposed budgets, which will create record deficits. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
The story of a man who might have a better grip on what's going on in the economy of middle-class America than all the experts you ever read in the paper or see on TV. Dave Ramsey hosts a call-in radio show about personal finance, but he ends up answering questions about more than money. Susan Drury reports from Tennessee. (His website: DaveRamsey.com ) (19 minutes) _Susan Drury_

Act Two
Producer Alex Blumberg bought a stock on a tip in 1997. By 1998 it was worthless. And now, in 2003, he sets off to find out why. What happened to his money and to the company he invested it in. (19 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

Act Three
A guy who writes under the pen name Greg Tate wrote a book called 11 Years, 9 Months and 5 Days , which is nothing more than a year-by-year account—one vignette after another—of things that happened to him in his minimum-wage job as a janitor in a fast food burger place that he calls "The Burger Store." Justin Kaufman reads surprisingly riveting excerpts. The book was self-published at xlibris.com . (12 minutes) _Justin Kaufman, Greg Tate_

      <description>Sure, John Kerry got in trouble for using the phrase, but we have no fear. Because we know that regime change, like charity, begins at home. This week: Stories of regime change in everyday life—people switching jobs, people switching families, businesses dying and new ones starting in their place.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with This American Life producer Julie Snyder about a personal regime change that happened when she was a kid, after her parents got divorced and her stepdad came on the scene. She says that by the time her parents separated, literature on what to tell the children was everywhere, and the kids took it relatively well. But her parents were less clear on how to introduce their new partners. And trying to fit a new stepdad into the picture was actually much more traumatic to Julie than dealing with the divorce. (7 minutes) _Julie Snyder_

Act One
Katie Davis tells the story of one storefront in her bustling commercial neighborhood that resists all occupation. Over the decades, many businesses have tried to operate there, none have succeeded. Katie tries to find out why. This story is part of Katie's ongoing series called Neighborhood Stories, which gets funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. (17 minutes) _Katie Davis_

Act Two
The story of a band of libertarians with a plan to take over a state. They call it the Free State Project and it goes like this: They pick a state with a low population, 20,000 of them move to it, establish a voting majority, and run it according to libertarian principles. Reporter Sarah Koenig travels with the leader of the movement, Jason Sorens, to one of the states on the potential takeover list—Vermont—to see what happens when the would-be invader meets the natives for the first time. Find out more about the Free State project at www.freestateproject.org. (22 minutes) _Sarah Koenig_

Act Three
Jeffrey Brown wrote a comic novel called Clumsy , a beautiful and intimate account of his relationship with his ex-girlfriend. He talks with Ira about the relationship and why he chose to draw cartoons about it after it ended. (7 minutes) _Jeffrey Brown_

      <description>Stories of what can and cannot be translated. A short, non-athletic, bespectacled East Asian studies major who couldn't make his high school basketball team finds himself in the NBA as the personal translator for the first-ever Chinese pro basketball superstar, Yao Ming. Plus, a Palestinian man teaches Hebrew classes in the Gaza strip to Palestinians eager to learn news from the other side of the checkpoint.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with producer Alex Blumberg about going on a date with a woman from Russia. Even though she spoke perfect English, the night was a misunderstanding, because they each had different ideas of what is meant by the words "good date." (7 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

Act One
Why is it that karaoke machines only have songs on them? If what they do is take a version of a public performance and allow the rest of us to give our own interpretations of the material, why aren't there other options, like the "you talkin to me?" scene from Taxi Driver , or Martin Luther King, Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech. Jonathan Goldstein and producer Starlee Kine find out why when they go to a karaoke club that has, along with all the songs, comedy routines for people to perform. (11 minutes) _Jonathan Goldstein, Starlee Kine_

Act Two
Very few Palestinians speak Hebrew, and very few Israelis speak Arabic, even though most Palestinians and Israelis live a short drive from one another. Nancy Updike has this story about Nasser Laham, a Palestinian TV journalist in Bethlehem who has a nightly show where he translates Israeli broadcasts into Arabic. It's a very popular show in Bethlehem, but it's complicated speaking your enemy's language. (19 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Three
The story of a not-very-tall, not-very-athletic man—Colin Pine—who becomes a minor celebrity in the NBA, as the translator for one of the most famous rookies in basketball history: The first Chinese player ever to go number one in the draft, Yao Ming. Reporter Jesse Hardman tells his story. (17 minutes) _Jesse Hardman_

      <description>Living behind enemy lines among the enemy, it's sometimes hard to remember why you're fighting in the first place.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass tells the enemy camp story the way we like it to be told. (2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Patrick Wall was a special kind of monk. He was a fixer. The Catholic Church sent him to problem parishes where priests had been removed because of scandal. His job was to come in, keep events from going public and smooth things over until a permanent replacement priest was found. But after four different churches in four years, after covering up for pedophiles and adulterers and liars and embezzlers he decided to make a change. Carl Marziali tells his story. You can read the statement from St. John's Monastery on sex abuse by their monks, and see the website of the Survivor's Network of Those Abused by Priests . (21 minutes) _Carl Marziali_

Act Two
You can divide all living creatures into two camps. We humans are in one camp, along with lots of other things like dogs and birds and trees and caterpillars. In the other camp are the things that live inside of us, the bacterias and viruses, the worms and protozoans, in short, parasites. Scientists estimate that the parasites outnumber us and our free-living allies by 3 to 1. Carl Zimmer, author of the book Parasite Rex , talks with Ira about how parasites manage the trick of living inside of us, behind enemy lines, without us finding out. (11 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
A short story, "Fatso," by Etgar Keret. A woman reveals to her boyfriend that she's not always what she seems. Keret is the author of the collection The Bus Driver Who Wanted to Be God . Matt Malloy reads. (6 minutes) _Etgar Keret, Matt Malloy_

Act Four
Two women in a small town find themselves on opposite sides of a protest. One is for the war in Iraq, one is against it, but despite this, they cross enemy lines and become friends. For a while anyway. Blue Chevigny tells the story. (14 minutes) _Blue Chevigny_

      <description>Stories about what the passage of time can do to someone. When each story starts, the world's aligned one way. Years pass—or sometimes just months—and everything's different.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass plays parts of a speech by George Ryan, former Governor of Illinois. When he was a state senator in 1977, Ryan was part of a successful coalition that voted to reinstate the death penalty in Illinois. Two decades later, he became governor and had to make the final decision in state capital cases—cases which he'd helped bring about 20 years earlier. He found that the death penalty looks a lot different when you're the one who bears final responsibility for whether someone lives or dies. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Scott Carrier tells the story of how the environmentalist that ranchers hated the most—whom they tried to run out of town and hanged in effigy—came to take the ranchers' side of things. Some funding for this story comes from Hearingvoices.com and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Scott Carrier is the author of the book Running After Antelope . (26 minutes) _Scott Carrier_

Act Two
A Houston woman tries to document every day of her four-year-old daughter's life...in preparation for a day far away. Produced by Julie Checkoway and Kimberly Meyer of Story Rodeo . (13 minutes) _Kimberly Meyer_

Act Three
A story by John Hodgman about returning to the beach after a very bad year. John Hodgman is the host of the monthly reading series The Little Gray Book Lecture Series. (9 minutes) _John Hodgman_

      <description>What is it about them, our mean friends? They treat us poorly, they don't call us back, they cancel plans at the last minute, and yet we keep coming back for more. Popular bullies exist in business, politics — everywhere. How do they stay so popular?

Prologue

Act Two
We conduct an experiment to test whether being nice actually pays by equipping two waitresses with hidden microphones to record their interactions. Each waitress is instructed to be super friendly with half of their tables while remaining aloof with the other half. We then compare the tips to see which approach was more profitable. Thanks to owners Jason Hammel and Lea Tshilds and the staff at the Lula Cafe in Chicago's Logan Square neighborhood. (10 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Prologue
Ira talks to historian Ted Widmer about two of the first pen pals in the New World. John Winthrop and Roger Williams were both Puritans in Massachusetts in the 1630s. Then Roger Williams was banished for suggesting the revolutionary idea that there should be separation between church and state. John Winthrop was the Governor of Massachusetts, which exiled him.  But the two men somehow stayed friends, writing letters long after Williams was sent away. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>What is this thing? This thing called love, that is. For answers, we explore the romance novel industry, a $1.5 billion empire run almost entirely by and for women. Plus, relearning the rules of romance from the other side of the gender line. And Sarah Vowell tells the story of the Greatest Romance of the 20th Century.

Prologue
We hear Billie Holliday, Keely Smith and Leo Reisman (with Anita Boyer) asking the musical question, "What Is This Thing Called Love?" And, reporter Sean Cole talks about love with Joe and Helen Garland, who fell in love during World War II, but married other people. Thirty years later they met again, felt the same love they felt when they were young, divorced their respective spouses, and finally married each other. (6 minutes) _Sean Cole_

Act One
Robin Epstein visits people who define this thing called love—for a living. She attends the annual convention of the Romance Writers of America . (17 minutes) _Robin Epstein_

Act Two
An act named after two TV shows, one where women sit around and talk, the other where men sit around and talk. If men are from Mars and women are from Venus, when you switch from one planet to another, what do you need to know about love? We hear from several transsexual men who've done exactly that. They were born as women, became men with the help of modern medical science, and had to re-learn how to love on the other side of the gender line. Griffin Hansbury reports. (22 minutes) _Griffin Hansbury_

Act Three
Sarah Vowell tells "The Greatest Love Story of the 20th Century," Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. (10 minutes) _Sarah Vowell_

      <description>Some stories we make happen, others happen to us. Extremes from the latter category, where people let things happen to them and don't act, even when maybe they should. David Rakoff guest hosts.

Prologue
David Rakoff tells a story from when he was a kid, about the day he realized the he would inevitably be viewed a certain way by his classmates, no matter what he did or said. (7 minutes) _David Rakoff_

Act One
For four hours in August 2001, KCAL-9, an all-news channel in Los Angeles, broadcast a very unusual police pursuit. The suspect drove under the speed limit, obeyed all traffic laws, signaled every time he wanted to turn. For the first three hours he's followed by a slow speed line of police cars, but for the last hour, he's driving alone—the police have called off the chase and are simply waiting for him to run out of gas. Producer Starlee Kine reports on the world's slowest car chase. (23 minutes) _Starlee Kine_

Act Two
When you get to know someone, really know them, you can almost predict their behavior. It's comforting, this intimacy. But what about when something comes up that requires people to transcend their character? Sheila Peabody tells the story of a moment when every single member of her family played their part as expected—with tragic circumstances. (10 minutes) _Sheila Peabody_

Act Three
A lot of life's inevitability is hazy; it'll happen some time, but you're not sure when. But with pregnancy, it's on an invariable schedule: forty weeks. Producer Wendy Dorr is currently at week thirty-six. She is experiencing an essential contradiction of pregnancy, which is the thing she is most looking forward to is also the thing that scares her. David Rakoff accompanies her to her Lamaze class to find out how you prepare for an inevitability that's on a fixed timetable. (5 minutes) _Wendy Dorr_

Act Four
A few times every summer, for complicated scientific reasons, thousands of live fish, crab and shrimp wash up onto the beaches of Mobile Bay, Alabama, on the Gulf Coast. It's a natural event—like a hurricane, but good. Locals call it Jubilee. Curtis Sittenfeld goes to Alabama to find out what it's like when the sea spontaneously sets up a gigantic raw bar. (10 minutes) _Curtis Sittenfeld_

      <description>We make what's usually invisible, visible: the world of trash. We follow the trash from the sanitation men on the street, to the mob guys who controlled the hauling business, to the people who actually live in dumps.

Prologue
Every day each American produces 4.8 pounds of garbage. Where does it all go? Ira talks with Robin Nagle, a anthropology professor at New York University who's been studying garbage,and says that most of us want garbage to be invisible. Which, usually, it is. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
The people who pick up our trash don't call themselves garbagemen. They're san men ("san" being short for "sanitation"). Host Ira Glass follows a couple of New York city san men around for a day (with NYU's Robin Nagle, who's writing about about the san men), to find out what 4.8 pounds of trash per person per day looks like from street level. (12 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
There are squatters who've built entire neighborhoods on top of rotting trash heaps in Mexico. They scavenge in the garbage piles for their living. Author Luis Urrea worked in one of these neighborhoods many years ago. He goes back to visit a friend who still lives there, in a small house with six teenage girls (three daughters, three nieces.) This is just fine with Luis's fourteen-year-old son, who goes with him. Luis Alberto Urrea is the author of several books of fiction and nonfiction, including By the Lake of Sleeping Children: The Secret Life of the Mexican Border and Across the Wire: Life and Hard Times on the Mexican Border . His story was produced by Barbara Ferry, with help from Sandy Tolan, Alan Weisman and Deborah Begel. It's part of the series "Border Stories" from Homelands Productions , which gets funds from The Ford Foundation and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. (19 minutes) _Luis Urrea_

Act Three
We hear the secret recordings that ended mob control of New York garbage collection, and talk to Rick Cowan, the NYPD detective who went undercover for three years to make them. He wrote a book about the case, with co-author Douglas Century, called Takedown: The Fall of the Last Mafia Empire . (14 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>Why is it always harder than you think it'll be? We explore several case examples of the annoying gap between theory and practice.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks to two people about their real-life stories of theory and practice. Subject 1: Michael. Theory: A couple years of boxing lessons will prepare you for a street fight with a real-world harasser. Practice: You slap harasser like little girl, cause him no pain, run away. Subject 2: Heather. Theory: if you have to go to the bathroom really bad and you pee on the school bus, no one will notice the pee, and if they do, they can't trace it to you. Practice: Spend the rest of elementary school known as peezilla. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Reporter Jack Hitt explains the alarming difference between theory and practice when it comes to computerized voting machines—specifically, those made by a company called Diebold. (16 minutes) _Jack Hitt_

Act Two
Alex Blumberg spends three days with Michigan state representative Steve Tobocman. He ran for office because he thought that would be the best way to change things for his neighborhood in Detroit. Can you change things from the inside without changing on the inside yourself? (26 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

Act Three
What happens if you're poor, and do everything right, all your budgeting, all your choices...are you actually any better off? Actor Liza Colón-Zayas reads a passage from Adrian Nicole LeBlanc's book Random Family . (7 minutes) _Liza Colonzeas, Adrian Nicole LeBlanc_

      <description>Biblical fables ripped from today's headlines. In his ongoing effort to write his own version of the Bible, Jonathan Goldstein retells the story of Cain and Abel. Finally we hear Cain's side of the story. Plus: neighbors in a small town in Illinois wonder if they could have stepped in—as their neighbors' keepers—to prevent a brutal triple murder. And the story of a man who lives his life among his political enemies, feeling responsible for the problems he believes they're creating for everyone.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks about the story of Cain and Abel, and the question in the story, "Am I my brother's keeper?" It turns out that the story doesn't really answer that question very satisfyingly. (2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Jonathan Goldstein retells the story of Cain and Abel. Finally we get to hear Cain's side of things. (18 minutes) _Jonathan Goldstein_

Act Two
We hear the story of someone trying to help all sorts of people who absolutely do not want his help. Nancy Updike reports on Dror Etkes, who has taken it as his personal mission to document the spread of Israeli settlements in the West Bank: Every shack, mobile home, housing cluster, bypass road and town. Settlement growth is something many people would rather keep quiet. The U.S. has repeatedly called for construction to stop. Dror Etkes is a reluctant activist. He initially had no interest in making this his life's work. Nancy Updike's story is part of the Hearing Voices Project , which gets funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. (21 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Three
Could anyone in a small farming town have done anything to prevent a brutal crime, committed by one of their neighbors? Robert Kurson first wrote about the March 2002 triple murder in Toulon, Illinois, for Chicago Magazine. His article has been reprinted in the anthology Best American Crime Writing 2003. (15 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>Stories from faraway, hard-to-get-to places, where all rules are off, nefarious things happen because no one's looking, and there's no one to appeal to.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with sailor and researcher Captain Charles Moore about a gigantic area in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, as far away from land as you can get, that is filling with plastic trash.

Act One
Nauru is a tiny island, population 12,000, a third of the size of Manhattan and far from anywhere: Yet at the center of several of the decade's biggest global events. Contributing editor Jack Hitt tells the untold story of this dot in the middle of the Pacific and its involvement in the bankrupting of the Russian economy, global terrorism, North Korean defectors, the end of the world, and the late 1980s theatrical flop of a London musical based on the life of Leonardo da Vinci called Leonardo, A Portrait of Love . (30 minutes) _Jack Hitt_

Act Two
This American Life senior producer Julie Snyder found herself in a ten-month battle with her phone company, MCI Worldcom, which had overcharged her $946.36. She spent hours on hold in a bureaucratic nowhere. No one seemed able to fix her problem, and there was no way she could make the company pay her back for all her lost time and aggravation. Finally, she enlists the aid of the national media—specifically, This American Life host Ira Glass. (22 minutes) _Julie Snyder_

      <description>In early 2003, we brought you a special showabout a California teenager, Hyder Akbar, who traveled to Afghanistan, his family's homeland, for the first time. His father had moved back to work for Afghan President Hamid Karzai. Hyder brought along a tape recorder, and his audio diary, produced by Susan Burton, won the Silver Award for Best Documentary at the 2003Third Coast International Audio Festival.

When Hyder was 17, he went to Afghanistan. This place that he'd been hearing about his whole life. And he took a tape recorder with him. Then the next summer he went back.

Act One
Hyder notices changes in Kabul in the year since he visited Afghanistan. Then he heads to Kunar, near the Pakistan border, one of the remote regions where Al Qaeda, the Taliban and local warlords are still fighting the new Afghan government and the U.S. military. Hyder visits a massacre site. He then finds himself pressed into service as a translator between American soldiers, local Afghans, and a former communist who's once again running things. (25 minutes) _Susan Burton_

Act Two
Hyder's story continues. He and his convoy of American soldiers run into trouble on their way back home. Hyder is asked to mediate between U.S. interrogators and a suspected terrorist, with confusing results. Hyder travels to the home of his Uncle Rauf. _Susan Burton_

      <description>Stories of people living without. Nubar Alexanian explains what fish can do for him that his own ears cannot. Sarah Vowell explains the cheerful journalism of deprivation. And other stories.

Prologue
It's hard to give things up. Host Ira Glass tells the story of Walter, a three-year-old boy who had to give up his pacifier, and then, wanting comfort, asked all the adults around him to tell the stories of when they gave up their pacifiers. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Nubar Alexanian was forced to give up one thing—and then gave up another thing by choice. This story was put together by Nubar and his daughter Abby, with help from Jay Allison , for Transom.org , with funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. It originally appeared on Transom's site. _Nubar Alexanian_

Act Two
Sarah Vowell introduces you to a magazine that—if you're lucky—you've never had to read. A magazine called Living Without. Her story is part of the Hearing Voices project, which gets funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Note: In 2011, we redid this show , replacing Sarah's essay with something else. Her essay is great, but the culture sort of caught up to the idea of gluten-free living and by the time we wanted to rerun the show six years after it was first broadcast, in an era where pizza places everywhere offer gluten free pizza, the story felt like a relic from a more innocent, gluten-ignorant era. (6 minutes) _Sarah Vowell_

Act Three
Every week, Chelsea Merz has lunch with a homeless man named Matthew, in the same restaurant. Matthew's been on the street for seven years, but once or twice a year, he housesits for a friend. She talked to him after he was housesitting for 16 days, on the day he went back out on the street. This story is part of a larger project Chelsea is putting together, with help from Jay Allison, the Cape and Island NPR stations, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. (8 minutes) _Chelsea Merz_

Act Four
Sometimes it's hard to figure out if you're doing something of your own choice or because someone wants you to do it. Actor Matt Malloy reads "Guilt," a short story by Judith Budnitz. _Matt Malloy_

      <description>For millennia, people have tried to reach a spiritual promised land by fasting. Jesus did it. Buddha did it. Monks and saints and new age gurus have done it. And, for for this episode, the late David Rakoff tried it. He did a 20-day fast, to find out if it would bring him any form of enlightenment. Also, contributor Starlee Kine tells a story about getting as close to one promised land as you possibly can, without actually going in.

Prologue
Fans of movie musicals might know about something called the "I Wish" number. In many movies and Broadway shows, it's the main character's first song, in which they express the hope that will set the story in motion. Host Ira Glass explains it, and plays a few examples. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Contributor Starlee Kine tells a story about getting as close to one promised land—Disneyland—as you possibly can, without actually going in. (14 minutes) _Starlee Kine_

Act Two
For millennia, people have tried to reach a spiritual promised land by fasting. Jesus did it. Buddha did it. Monks and saints and new age gurus have done it. And, for for this episode, David Rakoff tried it. He did a 20-day fast, to find out if it would bring him any form of enlightenment. David died in 2012, eight years after reporting this story. We devoted an episode to him and his stories. (25 minutes) _David Rakoff_

Act Three
Hillary Frank with a story of a train ride, an overheard conversation, and two people seeking two different promised lands. (7 minutes) _Hillary Frank_

      <description>There's what happened, and there's the story that gets told about what happened. Sometimes the two things don't match up very well. This week, two case examples—ripped, as they say, from today's headlines—of the story that's told becoming the truth, even though the facts don't back it up.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass discusses Howard Stern, who claims that current action by the FCC will take him off the air. We hear from Congressman Fred Upton of Michigan who heads the House committee passing new FCC fines, and from Brent Bozell who heads the Parents' Television Council. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Chris Neary tells the story of how a bungled Nazi sabotage operation from the early days of World War II has become the legal foundation for the Bush administration's current push to try U.S. citizens in military tribunals. But when you return to the original facts of the case, it's not only unclear if they support current Administration policy, it's unclear if they support the Supreme Court's decision in the original case. The attempted sabotage operation was chronicled in Washington Post reporter Michael Dobbs's excellent book, Saboteurs: The Nazi Raid on America . (36 minutes) _Chris Neary_

Act Two
Producer Sarah Koenig talks to the people behind survey results—whose answers determine so much of political news. And it turns out that maybe the numbers are more complicated than they appear. _Sarah Koenig_

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with two sisters, one high-school age, the other younger, about who gets treated better in the family. They all agree the youngest does.

(4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One

      <description>Today's show is devoted to just one story. Contributing editor Nancy Updike went to Iraq to try to figure out what it's like to be a private citizen working in the middle of a war zone. Private contractors are a part of this war in unprecedented numbers, but we don't know that much about the people doing these jobs — why they chose to come to Iraq, and what they're seeing that we can't.

Prologue
This American Life host Ira Glass talks about one thing you probably haven't heard about the occupational hazards of working in Iraq: Since you work every single day, you never know what day of the week it actually is. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
The private security guys (from a company called Custer Battles) who guard Baghdad International Airport usually get along fine with the U.S. military personnel stationed there—except when Nancy happened to be taping, and a huge fight broke out. (7 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Two
A former military man, Hank was hired by Custer Battles to clean up one of its other Iraq operations, guarding businessmen. He has a very clear idea of who he wants working for him: "flat-bellied, steely-eyed professionals." Instead, he's trying to tighten up a outfit whose workers once engaged in an extended firefight at a Baghdad hotel—against each other. (19 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Three
The Green Zone is where the Coalition Provisional Authority has set up its headquarters, and the former seat of Saddam Hussein's government. Nancy ends up at a hidden restaurant by a helipad, with workers for Fluor Corporation, who have just arrived in Iraq to fix power plants. (5 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Four
On their way out to a power plant, Nancy and Lee, a supervisor for Fluor in Iraq, get shot at by men in a BMW. When they finally get to the plant, Nancy learns why it's been so difficult to get power plants running again in the country. (7 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Five
Karen Hahn, who works for Custer Battles at the airport, started out there screening women passengers—and learned a lot from their handbags. Unlike most people Nancy met in Iraq, Karen is not a former military person, she doesn't work with guns or big machines, and she's never been happier in her life. (3 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Six
Hundred of Iraqi police officers have been killed since the United States invaded Iraq. One Boston cop, Jerry Burke, is trying to keep them on the job, and train them in Western police practices. Besides rogue officers, not having enough guns and bullet-proof vests, and men refusing to go on patrols, it's going OK. He's also having a hard time setting up his driver with his translator. (9 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Seven
Nancy finally gets Hank, the Custer Battles employee, to answer the question of whether he ever has any reservations about his mission—or the country's mission—in Iraq. John Kimbrough composed original music for this week's show. Nancy's story got support from HearingVoices.com , which gets funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting . (3 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Prologue
It seems apples for the teacher is a bygone tradition. Host Ira Glass talks to Mindy, a first-grade teacher, about the rather racy gifts her students give these days at Christmas. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
The FCC says it just wants a little civility on the nation's airwaves. And by tightening the rules on what swear words are allowed, government officials say they're protecting kids. The only weakness in their argument is that the facts don't happen to back them up. Ira talks with Dr Timothy Jay, author of Cursing in America and Why We Curse and John Cody, legal aide to FCC Chairman Michael Powell. Read the fascinating landmark FCC decision that's changing the rules, and the ACLU's Petition for Reconsideration . (30 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Ken Kurson, a Republican, runs for New Jersey State Assembly in a very, very Democratic district. He expects disagreement and debate. He doesn't expect his neighbors and friends to turn into vulgarians. (8 minutes) _Ken Kurson_

Act Three
Out with a man on a moonlit walk on Lake Geneva, an American woman does the proper thing. He does not. Samantha Hunt is the author of the novel The Seas . Her story was read by Claire Beckmann. (11 minutes) _Claire Beckmann, Samantha Hunt_

      <description>Three stories about people who decide to try out a new life—the kind of life their parents never wanted for them.

Prologue
How does a person who's not gay convince herself that she is for two years? Host Ira Glass talks to one of the show's contributing editors, Nancy Updike, about her two-year stint believing she was a lesbian, even though she was not attracted to women. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass, Nancy Updike_

Act One
Chaim and Billy both lived in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, just blocks away from each other, in worlds that almost never collided. Chaim was a Hasidic Jew—he'd never heard pop music or watched MTV. Billy Campion, known as the rocker Vic Thrill, was the star of an underground band. Billy put Chaim, who took on the name Curly Oxide, into the band, and in just one year, he leapt from the 19th century into the 21st. David Segal, rock critic for the Washington Post , reports. (39 minutes) _David Segal_

Act Two
A nice Florida girl changes high schools and takes the opportunity to try on a new personality...the slutty kind. Sascha Rothchild reads from her own teenage diary.

      <description>Letting someone else take care of you can change everything. Three stories of couples in which one partner is trying to take care of the other, sometimes with more resistance, sometimes with less.

Prologue
Susie and John Drury moved to their farm just two years ago. But when John got sick for awhile, people who were no more than friendly acquaintances started helping out in ways that completely surprised them. Host Ira Glass goes to Tennessee to hear their story. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>How, one might wonder, could a simple hunk of cheese drive a wedge between an aging aunt and her devoted niece? Sure, every family has its share of grudges, secrets and bad behavior. What's harder to understand is how those things end up changing family relationships in ways no one could have predicted. Three stories about family legends that have either been kicking around for years or been completely suppressed.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks to Eddie Schmidt about his Aunt Mary, the source of the best stories in his family—including how she was so cheap she stole azalea bushes from the side of the highway. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
We continue with the story of Eddie Schmidt and his parents, Josie and Bob, who tell the greatest Aunt Mary story of all time: the one about the provolone, the glance, and an aggrieved woman's attempt at revenge. (10 minutes) _Eddie Schmidt_

Act Two
Some family legends are most notable for their absence. They're too disturbing or scandalous to tell. Kevin O'Leary's family specialized in those. He tells the story of trying to find out the truth about his great grandfather—a man his relatives never, ever talked about. When he finds out, his family's reaction is almost as shocking as the story itself. (23 minutes) _Kevin O'Leary_

Act Three
The story of a prank that the family was building up to for years. But when the youngest sister executes it—perfectly—her mother can't forgive her. Katia Dunn tells the story of the worst college acceptance letter ever written. (15 minutes) _Katia Dunn_

      <description>Stories about adults struggling to figure out what is in the best interest of some child. And in situations where, what is best is not so clear.

Prologue
Colin Dunn had an A average as an eighth grader, and he was in a program for gifted kids. But he hated school. The spring before he graduated, he figured out that if he simply stopped going to school for the rest of the year, he'd still graduate with a B average. So that's what he did. Host Ira Glass talks to Colin and his dad, Corey, who had to deal with Colin's rebellion. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
The story of Colin's truancy continues. The whole thing was especially awkward for his dad, because he's a behavior specialist for 100 public schools in Oregon—including Colin's school. Corey wanted his son to go back, but he also knew how awful school can be for some kids. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
When she was three years old, Georgia was caught by immigration officials when a Milwaukee woman tried to bring her into the country illegally from Jamaica. She ended up at a residential detention center in Chicago. Alex Kotlowitz met her there, four years ago. At that time she was adored by some of the teenagers living at the center, and also by the staff—especially Hugo Ruiz, the center's director. Then, after living in Chicago for six months, she was sent back to her mother in Jamaica—to the same woman who gave her up. Years later, Hugo couldn't stop wondering whether it was the right thing to do. So he decided to go to Jamaica with Hugo to find Georgia. Alex Kotlowitz's most recent book is Never a City So Real . (43 minutes) _Alex Kotlowitz_

      <description>Stories of the Republican Party, America's new majority party. Yes, they're still just barely the majority in the Senate...and in the last Presidential race...and in state legislatures around the country, where they hold just one percent more seats than Democrats nationwide.

Prologue
Writer Thomas Frank went on the radio show On Point to talk about his book What's the Matter With Kansas? The book is about how people in his home state keep voting for Republicans even though Republican policies aren't helping them economically. But the people who called in to the radio show didn't exactly see it his way. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Patrick Howell, a gay Republican from Orlando, goes on what might seem like an ill-fated hearts-and-minds mission at the Republican Convention. (11 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
A visit to one of the many states where the GOP has been picking up strength, to see why and how. This American Life producer Alex Blumberg spends some time with the Alabama Republican Party. (16 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

Act Three
Mike is a Democrat, the yellow dog kind. The guys he works with—rich guys, like him—are mostly Republican. So he makes them an offer: He'll pay them lots of money if they dare to spend an evening doing something they find repellent: Watching the Michael Moore movie Fahrenheit 9/11. Shane DuBow reports. (13 minutes) _Shane DuBow_

Act Four
One of the most civil conversations you'll ever hear between GOP members on opposite sides of the party's culture war. Log Cabin Republican Patrick Howell from Act One sits down to talk with Christian Republican Steven King from Act Two, to hash out their differences. (10 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>Stories about people deciding whether to give it their all. There's one story about a person who hasn't, one story about someone who has—in a situation where success seems very unlikely—and one story about people who just can't help themselves.

Prologue
When you're in school, you're supposed to be a Renaissance person — do art, literature, sports, music—and be enthusiastic about it all. You get graded for effort. When we grow up, we're expected to transfer that give-it-your-all attitude into our adult lives, into situations where it doesn't really belong. Take Kenneth. He works as a greeter at a restaurant. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Hilary Hoffman wanted to give up his nine-to-five urban life. So he convinced his wife they could make it as organic farmers in rural Pennsylvania. It hasn't been going so well. The deer eat his vegetables. Weeds are strangling his strawberries. His muscles are constantly sore. Plus, he's just not a morning person. So This American Life arranges for him to get a makeover, agricultural style. George DeVault, a writer and editor at Rodale's New Farm magazine, who has his own organic farm , comes to the rescue. Shea Dean helped produce this story. (19 minutes) _Hilary Hoffman_

Act Two
When a 24-year-old runs for city council in Washington, D.C., he has to answer one question over and over: What's a 24-year-old doing running for city council? Sam Brooks is the candidate. At one point his campaign looks so hopeless, even he doesn't believe he's the better man for the job. He kept an audio diary, starting in February 2004. Sam's story was produced by Teal Krech. (21 minutes)

Act Three
Brett Martin documents a previously unnoticed human phenomenon, one that involves airplanes...crying...and Reese Witherspoon. (11 minutes)

      <description>Behind enemy lines, sometimes people get confused about whose side they're on and how to fight the enemy.

Prologue
Behind enemy lines, sometimes people get confused about whose side they're on and how to fight the enemy. (2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
In this election year, one question is rarely asked in a very direct way: Is the Bush Administration competent at conducting the war on terror? Every few weeks it seems like there's more news about how badly it's going: Senior Administration officials like Colin Powell now admit the insurgency in Iraq is growing; terror suspects like Yasir Hamdi (who supposedly were so dangerous that having a lawyer talk to them about their case would compromise national security) are released without trial because the evidence against them is so flimsy; there was the Abu Ghraib prison scandal; and just this week, the former head of the U.S. operation in Iraq, Paul Bremer, declared the problem from the start was that there were not enough troops there. Host Ira Glass discusses whether the Bush Administration is simply not very skilled at fighting terror with Richard Perle and James Fallows. Perle was one of the early advocates in Administration circles of going to war in Iraq. During the run-up to the war, he was chairman of the Defense Policy Board, a civilian advisory panel in the Pentagon. Fallows is national correspondent for The Atlantic Monthly , who has written extensively on the planning and early problems in the war in Iraq. (14 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Patrick Wall was a special kind of monk. He was a fixer. The Catholic church sent him to problem parishes where priests had been removed because of scandal. His job was to come in, keep events from going public, and smooth things over until a permanent replacement priest was found. But after four different churches in four years, after covering up for pedophiles and adulterers and liars and embezzlers, he decided to make a change. Carl Marziali tells his story. Read the statement from St. John's Monastery on sex abuse by their monks. Also, visit the website of the Survivor's Network of Those Abused by Priests. (21 minutes) _Carl Marziali_

Act Three
You can divide all living creatures into two camps. We humans are in one camp, along with lots of other things like dogs and birds and trees and caterpillars. In the other camp are the things that live inside of us, the bacterias and viruses, the worms and protozoans, in short, parasites. Scientists estimate that the parasites outnumber us and our free-living allies by 3 to 1. Carl Zimmer, author of the book Parasite Rex , talks with Ira about how parasites manage the trick of living inside of us, behind enemy lines, without us finding out. (9 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Four
"Fatso," a short story by Etgar Keret from his collection The Bus Driver Who Wanted to Be God . A woman reveals to her boyfriend that she's not always what she seems, especially at night. Matt Malloy reads. (6 minutes) _Etgar Keret, Matt Malloy_

      <description>Ten years ago, when he was still a reporter for NPR'sAll Things Considered, host Ira Glass did a year-long series on aChicago public schoolwhere things were getting better.Test scoreswere rising. Students were motivated. Last year, changes at the school dismantled some of the programs that had made for the school's success, and one of the best teachers in the school is thinking about quitting. We devote the whole hour to this story, about the rise and fall of school reform.

Prologue
When Ira heard that Cathy La Luz, the best public school teacher he'd met during all his years of education reporting, was considering leaving her job, he went to see her in her classroom. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Washington Irving Elementary School became a model of school reform in Chicago a decade ago. The school did it without adding a ton more money. It wasn't a magnet school or charter school. Their strategy: Get the kids to enjoy reading and writing, get them glasses if they need them, give teachers control of their classrooms. Scores climbed. Teachers like Cathy were happy. Students actually liked coming to school. We hear excerpts from Ira's 1994 All Things Considered series about the school. (21 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
We continue with the story of Irving Elementary, and hear what's happened to make Cathy La Luz think about quitting. In just nine months, the reforms that had made the school a model began to unravel. Well-meaning directives from the central school board undermined what the school was trying to do. And the new principal didn't quite understand why the teachers were balking at seemingly small things like writing up lesson plans. The climate in the school changes. The principal is oblivious. The head of the Chicago schools, Arne Duncan, says he'll look into the problems. Cathy's skeptical. © Copyright NPR® 1994, 1995.

      <description>A journey through the minds of undecided voters. For months—through the Swift Boat ads, the convention speeches, the debates—we tracked a few of these voters to find out why they just can't make up their minds. Plus, a story of someone courting undecided voters, and another about people trying to sabotage undecided voters (and everyone else).

Prologue
Host Ira Glass asks how it's possible that some people still don't know what they think of President Bush just a few days before election day. (2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Ira spends hours talking to James Hackett, known to his friends, and by the end of the story, to Ira, as Gig. He's a doctor in Cincinnati and a lifelong Republican. But he hates President Bush. Pretty much hates everything he's done since taking office. Over several months, he sways from Kerry to Bush and back again, sometimes with Ira's help, before coming to a final decision—one that probably surprises even him. (18 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Jack Hitt tells tales of voter sabotage so outrageous that we swear will get you yelling at your radio and calling for people's heads. (14 minutes) _Jack Hitt_

Act Three
Matthew Chasteen is 18 years old. He's joined the Navy, and he's voting for the first time. He doesn't know what to do. His brother David, an Iraq war veteran, is pushing Kerry, even though he'd been an enthusiastic Bush supporter last time around. His mom Monica is probably voting for Bush. She's in the Air Force Reserve and is headed to Iraq next year. Matthew is mostly confused by both their arguments. Producer Sarah Koenig goes to watch the first presidential debate with him, and suddenly Matthew makes his mind up with a vengeance. (14 minutes) _Sarah Koenig_

Act Four
This American Life producer Lisa Pollak goes canvassing with her friend Andy in Ohio. He's a first time door-knocker for MoveOn. He knows what to say to Kerry supporters. He knows what to say to Bush supporters. But he's a little hazy about how to handle the undecideds. (8 minutes) _Lisa Pollak_

      <description>It's rare that a successful apology happens. One where you apologize to someone, not for selfish reasons, but because you're really sorry and you want them to know that, and when the person you're apologizing to really hears what you're saying. Three stories of people groping toward that moment.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks about the surprising way apologies tend to play out in couples when one person has cheated on the other, based on stories his mother, Dr. Shirley Glass, told in her book Not Just Friends . And contributing editor Sarah Vowell tells us about the time she couldn't stop apologizing. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass, Sarah Vowell_

Act One
A story by regular contributor David Sedaris involving his sister Lisa, a secret, and her very understanding parrot. David read this story live, and it's on his CD Live at Carnegie Hall . The story is also published in his book Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim . (24 minutes) _David Sedaris_

Act Two
Tapes from The Apology Line , a phone line connected to an answering machine where people leave anonymous apologies—but not to the people they actually hurt. Also, an interview with "Mrs. Apology," a.k.a. Marissa Bridge. (10 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
Until recently, most insurance companies didn't want doctors to apologize to patients they'd harmed, for fear it could be used against them in lawsuits. Now, though, there's a new movement encouraging doctors to 'fess up and say sorry. There are even how-to manuals and instructional videos . The problem is, though, that some doctors just can't seem to get the words out. Starlee Kine reports. (17 minutes) _Starlee Kine_

      <description>Stories about people who love their cars, for better or for worse.

Prologue
We hear the eerily calm answering machine message that Brita Bonechi leaves for her husband, Rob, after she's had an accident and is trapped upside down in her car. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
David Segal of the Washington Post investigates the competitive world of db drag racing ("db" stands for "decibels"), where people customize their cars with stereos so loud that they can't actually be played—or listened to—at least not without risking a nose bleed. (14 minutes) _David Segal_

Act Two
Jamie Kitman tells the story of the car that broke his heart. He's the New York Bureau Chief for Automobile Magazine and the  automotive editor for Men's Journal . (6 minutes) _Jamie Kitman_

Act Three
When Darren's car was stolen in Washington, D.C., he did what everyone does: He called the police and figured he'd never see the car again. But within a week, as he was driving his rental he spotted his stolen Toyota, and chased it, with some help from the nice lady at 9-1-1. Curtis Sittenfeld tells the story. Her novel is called Prep . (10 minutes) _Curtis Sittenfeld_

Act Four
This American Life producer Sarah Koenig checks out competing sales techniques at a Chevy dealership on the south side of Chicago. It turns out the number two salesman thinks he's number one, and the number one salesman...is a grandmother, Yvonne Hawk. Her secret? Get them to call you "Mom." (11 minutes) _Sarah Koenig_

Act Five
People don't want to stop driving, no matter how old they get. This American Life producer Lisa Pollak talked with Rosyna Salerno, a 91-year-old widow, who recently gave up her license after she had a stroke. And Dan Neil, automotive critic for the Los Angeles Times , tells the story of Stirling Moss, the race car driver who, at 75, still holds the world record for completing a 1,000-mile race called the Mille Miglia. He did it by driving a Mercedes 100 miles per hour for ten hours. Dan got to take a drive with Moss in the famous car. (11 minutes) _Dan Neil, Lisa Pollak_

      <description>What life is like for American soldiers in Iraq.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks to Tom Irwin, a stand-up comic who recently performed for American troops all around Iraq for over a month. It seems his best joke, about Iraqi sheep farmers, only makes sense if you're a soldier on deployment. Irwin's one-man show about his trip is called "25 Days in Iraq." (2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
When an Arkansas National Guard Unit is sent off to Iraq, they assume they're going to help rebuild the country, since they're trained as an engineering unit. But once they arrive, they find themselves in a combat zone, unprepared and ill-equipped. Their trucks, for instance, are from the 1950s and 1960s. The unit's story is told in a documentary television series Off to War , which is on the Discovery Times cable channel. Ira interviews the filmmakers, Brent and Craig Renaud, and talks to a few of the guardsmen still stationed north of Baghdad. We also hear clips from the documentary. The series is produced by DCTV in New York. (39 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Rob Miller is a first lieutenant in the Marine Corps commanding a weapons platoon in "Charlie Company" of the First Battalion, Eighth Marines. He led his men recently in the battle of Fallujah, and in a recent satellite phone call, he told This American Life contributing editor Jack Hitt (who also happens to be his uncle) what we never seem to hear elsewhere: Details of what it's like to fight house-to-house in urban warfare. One of the weirdest moments in the recent battle of Fallujah? Hearing the psy-ops unit blast funky 1970s music across the city as Rob's battalion began its push. All he could think of, he says, was the movie Full Metal Jacket . (15 minutes) _Jack Hitt_

      <description>Sometimes, getting your big break isn't all it's cracked up to be. A comedy duo lands the gig that can make them famous—the Ed Sullivan Show at the height of Sullivan's popularity—and they bomb. A third-grader gets his big chance to please his mother and push his drunken father out of the picture. And other stories.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass tells the story of Marisela and Yadira, who were honors students in high school. They wanted to go to the best colleges, but they couldn't get federally-funded scholarships because they weren't U.S. citizens; they had come from Mexico when they were little. Through a series of fortunate breaks, they manage to scrape together enough money to go to college. Still, because of their illegal status, they have no idea if their education will get them anywhere in America. Helen Thorpe, a reporter in Denver, interviewed the students. (6 minutes) _Helen Thorpe_

Act One
Charlie Brill and Mitzi McCall were a comedy duo back in the mid-1960s, playing clubs around Los Angeles, when their agent called to tell them he'd landed them the gig of a lifetime: They were going to be on The Ed Sullivan Show . The only problem was that their performance was a total fiasco, for a bunch of reasons, including one they never saw coming. David Segal of The New York Times reports. (18 minutes) _David Segal_

Act Two
Two young men, Jeff Neumann and Ray Lemoine, decide it'd be interesting to be part of the rebuilding of Iraq. So they take a bus to Baghdad during the war and the bombings and the kidnappings and try to make their mark. Jen Banbury, who wrote for Salon.com from Baghdad, met Jeff and Ray there. She tells the story. (11 minutes) _Jen Banbury_

Act Three
Shalom Auslander reads his true story, "The Blessing Bee." It's about the time when, as a third-grader at an Orthodox Jewish school, Shalom saw his chance to both make his mom proud, and push his drunken father out of the picture. Part of his scheme involved winning the school's bee on the complicated Hebrew blessings you say before eating certain foods. The other part of the scheme: Sinning. Shalom's book of short stories is called Beware of God . "The Blessing Bee" will be published in his upcoming memoir. (19 minutes) _Shalom Auslander_

      <description>After four lawyers fail to get an innocent man out of prison, his friend takes on the case himself. He becomes a do-it-yourself investigator. He learns to read court records, he tracks down hard-to-find witnesses, he gets the real murderer to come forward with his story. In the end, he's able to accomplish all sorts of things the police and the professionals can't.

Prologue
Carl King, a self-taught investigator, talks about the murder case he's working on now—one the police think they've already solved. Carl got started in this business after freeing his close friend from prison. He now runs an organization, called Success to Freedom , devoted to helping wrongfully convicted inmates. This story was made into a film in 2017, called Crown Heights . (2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Reporter Anya Bourg tells the story of Carl King's first case, where he's able to accomplish what experienced detectives and lawyers were not. He proves that his friend was innocent. In this first half of the show, we hear the story of the crime. In 1980, Mario Hamilton was gunned down in the street in Brooklyn. A teenager claimed to have seen it happen. With police prompting, he fingered a guy named Collin Warner as the shooter. No matter that everyone in the neighborhood said someone else murdered Hamilton and that Warner had nothing to do with it. And no matter that the teenager hadn't witnessed the murder at all. A jury convicted Warner, and he was sentenced to 15 years to life for killing a man he'd never even heard of. Carl, his childhood friend couldn't let it rest, and started to fight the conviction. He tells everyone he can about the case. He tracks down witnesses. He teaches himself to read court documents. Eventually, he gets a real estate lawyer hooked on the case. (29 minutes) _Anya Bourg_

Act Two
The story of Collin Warner continues. His friend Carl manages to convince the real shooter and the victim's brother (who watched him die on the sidewalk) to testify on Collin's behalf. After 21 years in prison, Collin goes free. Original music for the show by Single Minded Pros (24 minutes) _Anya Bourg_

      <description>Stories about people who are remembered very differently than they'd wished. The ghost of a kindly, distinguished philanthropist supposedly plays pranks on guests at a Ramada hotel in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. A dying mother makes a tape for her developmentally disabled daughter, hoping she'll watch it someday, knowing she might not.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks to Laura Mayer, editor of the New Trier Township High School yearbook, about the renegade student who jumps into as many club photos as he can. And contributing editor Jack Hitt explains how this impulse—to be remembered as someone you're not—can be traced back to Benjamin Franklin. It turns out even the man who invented bifocals padded his resume for history. The key on the kite story, for instance?  Probably not true. (9 minutes) _Jack Hitt_

Act One
David Wilcox tells the story of how his mother, who was dying of lung cancer, made a short videotape for his sister, who is severely developmentally disabled. She hoped the tape would become a daily part of her daughter's life, like the other music and movies she liked to play, that she would watch it and remember her mother. But she also knew her daughter might never even see it. And we hear two stories from people who recorded their own memories in a booth in Grand Central Station in New York, as part of the StoryCorps project. The first is Don "Moses" Lerman, a champion eater who's thought a lot about what he'll be remembered for. The second is Ronald Ruiz, a bus driver, who's never forgotten one of his passengers. StoryCorps funders include the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, National Public Radio, the Ford Foundation and the Open Society Institute. (9 minutes) _David Wilcox_

Act Two
Starlee Kine rents a room at a Ramada hotel in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, where a ghost supposedly plays pranks on the guests and staff. The ghost's name is Walter, for Walter Schroeder, the guy who originally built the hotel in the 1920s. It turns out Walter was a successful businessman and a kindly philanthropist who threw great dinner parties. So why would he bother haunting a Ramada? Starlee originally wrote and read a version of this story for The Little Gray Books Lecture Series . And...two more stories about remembering, from StoryCorps. The first is a conversation between Ralph Tremonte and and Donald Weiss, who were in mental institutions together as kids, and are reunited after 40 years. The second is Brad Skow talking to his mother, Mary Lou Maher, who gave him up for adoption when she was 17. (14 minutes) _Starlee Kine_

Act Three
Writer Shalom Auslander reads his short story about how he decided to start forgetting the dead, even though his job required him to remember. Shalom's most recent book is Hope: A Tragedy . (15 minutes) _Shalom Auslander_

      <description>Stories about people teetering on the edge of this question: Should they stay or go? A software writer loses his job, but refuses to go away.

But now that graduation is almost here, Muhammad thinks he might want to stay in America. On the other hand, he also misses his family terribly, and knows his parents will be heartbroken if he stays. He takes a trip home—his first since he left—knowing his family will do everything possible to convince him to return home permanently.

      <description>Stories of people who try simple mind games on others, and then find themselves way in over their heads.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass interviews Lori Gottlieb about the time she sent a letter to a writer in a magazine, a letter packed with white lies. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Lori Gottlieb's story continues. One complication led to another, and before long, the writer seemed to be lying to her. Or maybe he wasn't. It was hard to tell. Years later, she still isn't sure what happened. Gottlieb is the author of Maybe You Should Talk to Someone and other books. (8 minutes)

Act Two
A group called Improv Everywhere decides that an unknown band, Ghosts of Pasha , playing their first ever tour in New York, ought to think they're a smash hit. So they study the band's music and then crowd the performance, pretending to be hard-core fans. Improv Everywhere just wants to make the band happy—to give them the best day of their lives. But the band doesn't see it that way. Nor does another subject of one of Improv Everywhere's "missions." (31 minutes) _Jorge Just_

Act Three
Scott Carrier and his family live in the same Salt Lake City neighborhood as Elizabeth Smart, the fourteen-year-old whose 2002 kidnapping made international news. Though Smart's picture was plastered everywhere throughout Salt Lake City and thousands of volunteers searched for her, her captors brazenly brought her back to the very neighborhood from which she'd been taken. They walked freely through the streets with her in broad daylight, yet no one recognized her. Scott talks with his neighbors and his son Milo—who had attended grade school with Smart—about what was going through their minds that prevented them from seeing what was right there in plain sight. Scott's podcast is called Home of the Brave . His story received support from hearingvoices.com , which gets support from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. (12 minutes) _Scott Carrier_

      <description>Stories about people who end up making choices they'd rather not make, when their options begin to run out. Sometimes this works out great; sometimes not so great.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass interviews Joe Amrine, who was falsely accused of murder. Rather than avoid the death penalty, Amrine said everything he could think of on the witness stand to get the jury to give him a death sentence. He figured that would be better than life in prison. Since he would need media attention and free legal help to appeal his case, he calculated the only way he could get it was to sit on death row, because nobody pays attention to lifers. He nearly was executed, and lived on death row for seventeen years before being released. Joe's story is a part of the McSweeney's Voice of Witness Project —Oral Histories of Victims of Contemporary Human Rights Abuses and Social Injustices. (8 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Dawna Lentz was a new employee at Quiznos sub shop in Seattle when the franchise owners just gave up. They stopped buying supplies, stopped answering their phones. Soon, the restaurant began running out of staple ingredients, like cold cuts and bread. But Dawna needed the job. So she paid the other employees out of the cash register, and started scrounging to keep the place open. Shirleen Holt, a reporter for the Seattle Times , tells the story of how Dawna managed to stay afloat. (17 minutes) _Shirleen Holt_

Act Two
Charles Johnson was living in St. Louis, married with a young daughter, and he had no job. He looked around, and decided he'd try trucking. There was this company offering to train and hire drivers, so he signed up. The only problem was, he couldn't read. Jonathan Menjivar reports on how Charles traveled all across the country making deliveries, without ever consulting a map. And without ever telling anyone—even his own wife and brothers—that he couldn't read. The literacy program where Charles learned to read accepts volunteers. Their website: LiteracyChicago.org . (16 minutes) _Jonathan Menjivar_

Act Three
How NOT to get a job in U.S. intelligence: Admit to being a pervert during your job interview. Somehow, though, that's exactly what happened to a perfectly normal, nice guy who we're calling "Matt" for the purposes of this story. On paper, Matt was a perfect candidate to be an analyst for the National Security Agency. He was bright, ambitious, spoke Chinese. But he was also a little neurotic. So somewhere in the midst of his final round of testing for the NSA job, he started to worry about this riddle: What if I've done something bad, but I don't know I've done it? Am I still guilty? This, it turns out, is not the best way to approach a lie detector test. Brian Montopoli, Matt's friend, interviewed him about what happened. (15 minutes) _Brian Montopoli_

      <description>In honor of Father’s Day, stories of sons and daughters finding out the one thing they've always wanted to know about their father. The answers aren't always what they’d hoped for.

Prologue
As a kid, Aric Knuth sent cassette tapes to his dad, a merchant marine gone for months at a time. He’d leave one side blank and ask for a reply—but none ever came. Aric talks to Ira Glass about what it was like to finally ask his dad why. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Lennard Davis was always told to avoid his no-good Uncle Abie. After his father died, Abie claimed he was actually Lenny’s biological father via artificial insemination. At first, the story seemed possible, then doubtful. It took Lenny more than 20 years to sort out whether it was true, and he finds out the answer—definitively—as tape is rolling. Lennard Davis wrote a book about these experiences, called " Go Ask Your Father ." (31 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Paul Tough’s father was a mild-mannered professor—until he suddenly left the family to pursue a lifelong quest: making contact with extraterrestrial life. For the first time, Paul joins him and asks the questions he’s long kept to himself about his father’s alien pursuits. Paul Tough is one of the original contributing editors to This American Life . His father's website is ieti.org . (18 minutes) _Paul Tough_

      <description>At a time when House Majority Leader Tom Delay calls for enacting a "Biblical world view" in government, when Christians are asserting their ideals in the selection of judges, in public school science classes and elsewhere,This American Lifespends an hour trying to remember why anyone liked the separation of church and state in the first place.

Prologue
Two stories about people who suddenly realize they're the only ones around who value the separation of church and state. Paul Williams, a city councilman in Janesville, Wisconsin, wants to make sure a Salvation Army built with public money doesn't proselytize. Soon he's getting attacked in the local press...and by President Bush. And a Georgia teacher finds that by teaching what she's supposed to teach—evolution—she turns her school against her. (9 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
We hear a quick rundown of all the ways that Christian conservatives are making headway in advancing their values as public policy, why they think total separation of church and state is not what the founding fathers intended. And why they're wrong. On the Christian side of this argument is Pastor Russell Johnson of the Ohio Restoration Project , which is trying to recruit "patriot pastors" to get involved in state politics; and Bill Carrico, a Virgina legislator who's trying to make sure people can express their Christianity in schools and other public places. And then there are the videos and speeches of David Barton, whose group, Wallbuilders , is trying to teach people that the founding fathers meant for America to be a Christian country. On the other side are Rob Boston, spokesman for Americans United for Separation of Church and State , and Cornell government professor Isaac Kramnick, co-author of The Godless Constitution . (20 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Julia Sweeney , a Catholic, tells the story of how her faith began to crack after reading a most alarming book...called the Bible. Her story is excerpted from her play, "Letting Go of God," which ran in Los Angeles. Her other one-woman monologues are "God Said, 'Ha!'" and "In the Family Way." (29 minutes) _Julia Sweeney_

      <description>Stories about getting back together with your parent, your spouse, your ... Brahman bull. And how it never goes the way you think it's going to.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks about some truths contained in the 70's hit "Reunited," by Peaches and Herb. (2 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
The story of an Iranian couple who were unhappily married for 27 years. He had a temper. She never really loved him. So they split up, got divorced. And then, two years after that, to everybody's surprise, especially their grown-up children, they fell in love and married each other again. And this time, everything was different. One of their daughters, Nazanin Rafsanjani, tells the story. (25 1/2 minutes) _Nazanin Rafsanjani_

Act Two
Ralph and Sandra Fisher, who run a show-animal business in Texas, had a beloved Brahman bull named Chance. Chance was the gentlest bull they'd ever seen, more like a pet dog than a bull. They loved him, kids loved him. He had a long career in movies, on TV, performing at parties. When he finally died, Ralph and Cindy were devastated. Around that same time, scientists at Texas A&M University were looking for animal subjects for a cloning project. They already had some tissue from Chance because they'd treated him for an illness. So Ralph and Cindy offered up Chance's DNA for the experiment. Second Chance was born. And he was, eerily, just like Chance. Except he wasn't. Which they found out the hard way. (21 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
Sarah Vowell tells the story of General Lafayette's triumphant reunion with America, after becoming really, really unpopular in his native France. Sarah's is the author of “ Lafayette in the Somewhat United States ” among other books. (7 1/2 minutes) _Sarah Vowell_

      <description>The U.S. government spent two years on a sting operation trapping an Indian man named Hemant Lakhani, whom they suspected of being an illegal arms dealer. It's one of the few cases that has gone to trial in the War on Terror, and one the Justice Department has pointed to as one of their big successes. In the end, they got Lakhani, red-handed, delivering a missile to a terrorist in New Jersey. The only problem was, nothing in the sting was what it appeared to be. Including the missile.

Prologue
The government had an almost impossible task after the September 11th attacks: They had to try to stop terrorists before they did anything — in some cases, before they even committed a crime. Dr. William Banks, a law professor and head of Syracuse University's Institute for National Security and Counterterrorism, talks about the difficulties of this mandate. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Hemant Lakhani, an Indian-born British citizen, had been a salesman all his life. Clothing, rice, oil...it didn't matter to him what the product was, as long as he could spin a deal. Then one day, sitting in a hotel room with a gangster he happened to know, the phone rang. It was a business friend of the gangster's, calling from America. The man on the phone was rich, Lakhani was told. Maybe he would invest in Lakhani's latest venture. So Lakhani started talking to the man over the phone. Pretty soon they set up a meeting at a hotel in New Jersey, to talk business. But when Lakhani got there, the man seemed to be only interested in buying illegal weapons for Somali terrorists. Lakhani, always eager to make a deal, said he can help him out. What he didn't know, is that the supposed rich business man was an FBI informant, and that he had just walked into an elaborate government sting. Petra Bartosiewicz reports. (30 minutes) _Petra Bartosiewicz_

Act Two
Our story about Hemant Lakhani's case continues, through the sting and the trial. (23 minutes) _Petra Bartosiewicz_

      <description>Stories about the pitfalls of knowing just a little bit too little.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass describes the thing that we all do at some point: Talk expertly about something we don't actually know anything about. It's so common, explains This American Life contributing editor Nancy Updike, that some friends of hers invented an imaginary magazine devoted to such blathering. It's called "Modern Jackass." (4 minutes) _Ira Glass, Nancy Updike_

Act One
This American Life producer Alex Blumberg investigates a little-studied phenomenon: Children who get a mistaken idea in their heads about how something works or what something means, and then don't figure out until well into adulthood that they were wrong. Includes the tale of a girl who received a tissue box for Christmas, allegedly painted by trained monkeys. (13 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

Act Two
Six-year-old DJ has two dads, Dan Savage and Terry Miller. DJ is being raised by two gay men, but he has a preschooler's understanding of what gay means. Which is to say, he doesn't understand it at all. Though he does oppose gay marriage. Dan, the author of the syndicated column and book Savage Love , tells the story. (12 minutes) _Dan Savage_

Act Three
Bob Berenz had a good job as an electrician. But he wanted to do something bigger. He came up with an idea for an invention. But as he studied physics texts to see if his invention could work, he happened upon the biggest idea of his life: A revelation about physics that would disprove Einstein, and Newton. That is, if Bob's right. Bob's friend, Robert Andrew Powell, reports the story. He's a sports writer and the author of We Own This Game , about youth football. (16 minutes) _Robert Andrew Powell_

Act Four
Writer Alexa Junge tells about the time when she was thirteen and she decided to have a "grown-up" conversation with her beloved grandmother. (10 minutes) _Alexa Junge_

      <description>Stories of people and institutions who are worried about what the world thinks of them, and who take action...decisive action.

Prologue
Kristy Kruger realized in college just how bad her high school education had been. She was always having to pretend she knew what the people around here were talking about when she didn't know. And so she devised a troll-based system for getting through those moments without people thinking she was dumb. ( Kristy's a musician in Dallas.) (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Alex Blumberg tells the story of an audacious act of rebranding done by a group of people who aren't normally thought of as very audacious: public librarians. In Michigan, they've started staging rock concerts in libraries. The band that's been thrown into the experiment— The High Strung —couldn't be more perfect for the job. (23 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

Act Two
Jonathan Goldstein decides to find out—once and for all—if his dad Buzz thinks he's manly enough. (15 minutes) _Jonathan Goldstein_

Act Three
Julie Hill explains how she's going to remake all the ideas her son has about his father, using a very simple tactic. (11 minutes) _Julie Hill_

      <description>Surprising stories from survivors in New Orleans. We give people who were in the storm more time than daily news coverage can to tell their stories and talk about what they're thinking. This leads to a number of ideas that haven't made it into the regular news coverage.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks about something he read that seemed to put an end to all debate over one of the key issues swirling around right now. He checks with William Nichelson, author of the books Emergency Response and Emergency Management Law and Homeland Security Law and Policy , to see if he's correctly understanding the issue. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
In the days following Hurricane Katrina, Denise Moore was trapped in the New Orleans Convention Center with her mom, her niece, and her niece's two-year-old daughter. There, she witnessed acts of surprising humanity by armed vigilantes, taking charge and doing good. (16 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
To find out more about the bridge Denise talked about in act one and the armed police who prevented pedestrians from crossing, This American Life producer Alex Blumberg talks with Lorrie Beth Slonsky and her husband Larry Bradshaw. They're paramedics from San Francisco who were visiting New Orleans for a convention when Hurricane Katrina hit. After the storm, they tried to escape the city in a number of ways. When they tried to leave the city on foot, they were told, at gunpoint, by police, that they must turn back. We also hear from Debbie Zelinsky, who was with them. (17 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

Act Three
We compare Fox TV talk show host Bill O'Reilly's ideas about the hurricane's aftermath with those of Ashley Nelson, an 18-year-old who lives in the Lafitte Housing projects in New Orleans, in one of the flooded neighborhoods. Among other things, she explains what it feels like to go without food and water for two days. Ashley is the author of an amazing book called The Combination , about her neighborhood in New Orleans. Contact The Neighborhood Stories Project for information on getting a copy. (6 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

Act Four
Hundreds of thousands of Gulf residents evacuated before the storm and followed the whole thing from afar. Cheryl Wagner left for Gainesville, Florida, where her friends advised her to buy a gun and a mean dog before returning home to New Orleans. (4 minutes) _Cheryl Wagner_

Act Five
In August 2004, Hurricane Charley devastated parts of Florida. Afterwards, FEMA built a trailer park to provide immediate temporary housing for those who'd lost their homes in the storm. More than a year later, over 500 trailers are still there—and in them, more than a thousand people with nowhere else to go. Just this week in the New York Times , a FEMA official said that the kinds of mobile homes found in Punta Gorda may become "the standard" for those left without homes due to Hurricane Katrina. This American Life producer Lisa Pollak talked to the park's residents to see how things are going and talk about their prospects for moving on a year later. (5 minutes) _Lisa Pollak_

      <description>It's the largest mass resettlement that America has seen since the Civil War, as over 400,000 people—victims of Hurricane Katrina—try to find a new place to live. From the Houston Astrodome to an abandoned New Orleans street, stories of people looking for home...and finding something else.

Prologue
At the Astrodome complex in Houston, charities from Colorado and Florida and other states are competing to take in the hurricane's refugees. But Colorado, which offers the best package of any state, just can't get New Orleans residents to relocate there. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Producer Jane Feltes talks with the first people on line for the bus to Colorado: Two twin, six-year-old sisters. (3 minutes) _Jane Feltes_

Act Two
Host Ira Glass talks to evacuees about what it's like to live on a cot in the Astrodome and the Reliant convention center next door. The lights never go out, and the p.a. runs announcements all day. But there are some upsides. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
As a half-dozen families—including a pregnant woman having contractions and another with a four-week-old baby—are driven around Houston looking for housing, they confront potential neighbors who they believe don't want them...and neighbors they themselves don't want. This American Life producer Lisa Pollak reports. (20 minutes) _Lisa Pollak_

Act Four
Nick Spitzer, host of the Public Radio International music show American Routes , drives through deserted streets to return to his own house, and finds it doesn't feel at all like home. (14 minutes) _Nick Spitzer_

Act Five
Louann Mims, a 78-year-old retiree, planned to leave her New Orleans house before the floodwaters rose, but then the water came rushing in and she was trapped in her house for eight days on the only thing that would float: her extra firm Sterns and Foster mattress. Ms. Mims talks with Alex Kotlowitz, the author of The Other Side of the River , Never a City So Real , There Are No Children Here , and other books. (10 minutes) _Alex Kotlowitz_

      <description>How far will we go to get money? And once we've got it, what should we spend it on? The first half of this show is on making money, and the second half on spending it.

Prologue
Marti Noxon used to work for a company that did "product placement" for the movie industry. When auditors came to check that clients were being correctly billed, the company's bosses took unusual steps. Namely, they hired actors to play the employees who were supposedly on the payroll. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Five stories of people doing what they think they have to, in order to make ends meet. A suburban dad makes what seems like a rational choice (to him, at the time, anyway) to start robbing laundries and banks. A trader at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange describes how he got rich from the Chernobyl disaster. They all talked with Alex Kotlowitz. Amy Drozdowska-McGuire produced the stories. Versions of them first appeared on Chicago Public Radio's series Chicago Matters , which gets funding from the Chicago Community Trust. (29 minutes) _Alex Kotlowitz_

Act Two
Producer Diane Cook investigates that moment when you realize you've become "that guy" you've always hated, and how the simple act of purchasing deodorant can lead to that moment. (10 minutes) _Diane Cook_

Act Three
John Hodgman provides an occasionally true account of seven days spent at the Mall of America. After crossing mall officials, he goes rogue, drinking from the flume ride and exploring what he describes as a secret tunnel lined with human skulls. The story is part of his book The Areas of My Expertise. (10 minutes) _John Hodgman_

      <description>Stories about people and places that have come back to life after everything seemed lost.

Prologue
In the middle of the news coverage of Hurricane Rita, newscasts broke into their coverage to show JetBlue flight 292, with its landing gear stuck in the wrong direction. For hours, the plane circled over the exurbs of Los Angeles to burn off fuel before it attempted an emergency landing. Host Ira Glass talks to passenger Alexandra Jacobs about what it's like to be on a plane that might not make it back safely. (14 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Ira Glass continues talking to passengers, like Zach Mastoon and Dave Reinitz, about being on that JetBlue flight. (14 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
This American Life producer Sarah Koenig visits Pearlington, Mississippi, a town in danger of not starting up again after Hurricane Katrina. It's in Hancock County, the Ground Zero of the hurricane's devastation. Sarah found people pitching in together, without much government help or leadership. Nobody is clear about who's in charge. (24 minutes) _Sarah Koenig_

Act Three
About fifteen miles from Pearlington, Bay St. Louis and Waveland are other communities struggling to bring themselves back to life. Waveland was pretty much completely wiped out. Bay St. Louis isn't much better. And though you still can't drink the tap water, and some people still don't have electricity, and school won't reopen until November, people wanted something normal in their lives again, and so high school football's back again. Even though there's no school. The Tigers face enormous odds. Over half their team never came back after Hurricane Katrina. Many of the rest are homeless, living on couches, living away from their parents. Their equipment was ruined. Their uniforms taken by refugees from the flood. National Guardsmen are camping on their practice field. This American Life producer Lisa Pollak attended their first game. (18 minutes) _Lisa Pollak_

      <description>About a year ago, a study estimated the number of Iraqi casualties since the war began at 100,000 dead—higher than any other estimate. The study was mostly ignored. Alex Blumberg revisits that study to look at the reality behind it. In Act One he reports that not only is the study probably accurate, but it says that most of the deaths were caused by coalition forces (despite concerted efforts to avoid civilian casualties). In Act Two, we hear U.S. forces trying to cope in the aftermath of some of those deaths.

Prologue
We're a nation at war, but it hardly feels like it. That contrast is especially jarring for people like Hannah Allam, who just returned home to Oklahoma after two years in Baghdad running the Knight-Ridder Newspapers bureau there. Host Ira Glass talks with Hannah and Army Captain Chuck Ziegenfuss about what it feels like to come home from a war that nobody's paying much attention to. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
About a year ago, a John Hopkins University study in the British medical journal The Lancet estimated the number of civilian casualties in Iraq. It came up with a number—100,000 dead—that was higher than any other estimate, and was mostly ignored. This week, Producer Alex Blumberg tells the remarkable story of what it took to find that number, why we should find it credible and why almost no one believed it. (The original Lancet study is online; free registration is required). (38 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

Act Two
Captain Ryan Gist was given a particularly tough assignment in Iraq: To build relationships with a town where U.S. bombs had killed twelve innocent people. But first he has to apologize to the families of those who were killed. We hear the apology, captured on tape by a journalist working in Iraq, and talk to Captain Gist about what things have been like since. (10 minutes)

Act Three
So if, in fact, 100,000 Iraqis died because of the war—and that number is a year old—what do we do with that number? It instantly brings you to all these imponderable questions about what's worth 100,000 dead. In a way, this doesn't seem like a helpful question to think about. So Ira turns to Nancy Sherman, who writes about the military and its values. She's a professor of philosophy at Georgetown University and was the Distinguished Chair of Ethics at the U.S. Navy Academy. She also wrote Stoic Warriors . (3 minutes) _Ira Glass, Nancy Sherman_

      <description>Stories about the lengths we go to make things right, and about what money can and cannot fix.

Prologue
Erin Einhorn grew up begging her mother to tell her all about the remarkable story of how she survived World War Two, thanks to a Polish woman named Honorata Skowronski, who risked her life. But her mother didn't like to talk about it. And somehow, her family didn't consider Honorata a hero. So Erin went to Poland, hoping to find the Skowronski family and reintroduce them to her mom, and figure out what happened.  Erin elaborates on this story in her book, The Pages In Between . (5 minutes) _Erin EInhorn_

Act One
Erin Einhorn's story continues. She tells what happens once she arrives in Poland. Things start well, with the kind of sweet, tearful reunion she hoped for. That is, until the family starts explaining that they need Erin's help to keep a 60-year-old promise that her grandfather made. Erin immediately agreed, but now after years of effort, thousands of dollars, and a trail of letters which uncovered a whole new side to the story, Erin is asking: How far do you go to repay this kind of debt? (34 minutes) _Erin EInhorn_

Act Two
Beau O'Reilly gets a chance to settle a 17-year-old score with the help of the Chicago police. (17 minutes) _Beau O'Reilly_

      <description>Someone once said, "If you're not willing to be changed by a place, there's no point in going." This week, stories about what happens when you land in a whole new world.

Prologue
It took almost a month for Eli Ramirez to make it to this country. A native of Guatemala, he was smuggled through Mexico in the transport tank of a fuel truck, he was stranded in the desert, and forced to drink his own urine to survive. But just 24 hours after he made it to Chicago, he found himself at Charlie Trotters—one of the most exclusive, expensive, and fanciest restaurants in the country—a place unlike anything he'd ever seen before. If you'd like to read more about Eli, his story is featured in the new book An Immigrant Class: Oral Histories from Chicago's Newest Immigrants , by Jeff Libman. (4 minutes) _Eli Ramirez_

Act One
Chris Tenove had this idea he thought could really make a difference for people in the developing world. The thought was to bring well-meaning tourists where their money would do the most good, spend some time with the locals, and then leave behind a little money to help out. To see if his idea has any merit, Chris decided to try it out...by himself. In Sierra Leone. (19 minutes) _Chris Tenove_

Act Two
Lots of soldiers in Iraq are writing about their experiences online. Producer Amy O'Leary has read through dozens of them and talks about what the soldiers are writing. Then, we hear from three bloggers, reading their own journals, telling their stories from Iraq about the fighting, the locals, and why you subscribe to Details magazine. We hear from Captain Chuck Ziegenfuss, Trueman Muhrer-Irwin , and Colby Buzzell , who has recently compiled a book of his war writing called My War: Killing Time in Iraq . (32 minutes) _Colby Buzzell, Amy O'Leary_

      <description>Variations on an old tale, with very modern consequences. Cambodia is competing with other nations for the business of big clothing companies all over the world...but they've vowed to follow fair labor practices. Other countries end up with the contracts, and the profits.

Prologue
Lisa LaBorde has two daughters, and having grown up an only child, she can't understand why they fight all the time. Her idea of sisterhood is more like a scene from The Sound of Music. Wanting to create that kind of bond for her girls, Lisa decides to enlist the aid of science to see if she can turn these enemies into friends—in just one month. (4 minutes) _Lisa LaBorde_

Act One
Continuing from our prologue, host Ira Glass checks in with Lisa and her older daughter, Kennedy, to see how the experiment went. After a month, they've charted surprising results, learned that the girls aren't the only ones in the house who need to change, and found out just how much money it takes to get a twelve-year-old to play with a five-year-old. (14 minutes) _Ira Glass, Lisa LaBorde_

Act Two
Rachel Louise Snyder reports on the struggle to save the Cambodian economy. Right now, Cambodia is competing with other nations for the business of big clothing companies all over the world—buyers like the Gap, Nike, Adidas. But they've vowed to follow fair labor practices, which, while eliminating sweatshops for workers, also makes their costs higher. Other countries end up with the contracts—and the profits. So an official Cambodian committee sets out on a mission to convince the U.S. Congress to give them a special trade agreement, before time runs out. With additional reporting by TAL producer Lisa Pollak. (30 minutes) _Lisa Pollak, Rachel Louise Synder_

Act Three
Contributor David Sedaris uncovers a disturbing and hidden trend that's taking place where small-minded people collide with big retail stores. (6 minutes) _David Sedaris_

      <description>The story of Reverend Carlton Pearson. He was a rising star in the evangelical movement when he cast aside the idea of hell and, with it, everything he'd worked for over his entire life.

Prologue
Carlton Pearson's church, Higher Dimensions, was once one of the biggest in the city, drawing crowds of 5,000 people every Sunday. But several years ago, scandal engulfed the reverend. He didn't have an affair. He didn't embezzle lots of money. His sin was something that to a lot of people is far worse: He stopped believing in hell. (2 minutes) _Russell Cobb_

Act One
Reporter Russell Cobb takes us through the remarkable and meteoric rise of Carlton Pearson from a young man to a Pentecostal Bishop: From the moment he first cast the devil out of his 17-year-old girlfriend, to the days when he had a close, personal relationship with Oral Roberts and had appearances on TV and at the White House. Just as Reverend Pearson's career peaked, with more than 5,000 members of his congregation coming every week, he started to think about hell, wondering if a loving God would really condemn most of the human race to burn and writhe in the fire of hell for eternity. (30 minutes) _Russell Cobb_

Act Two
Once he starts preaching his own revelation, Carlton Pearson's church falls apart. After all, when there's no hell (as the logic goes), you don't really need to believe in Jesus to be saved from it. What follows are the swift departures of his pastors, and an exodus from his congregation—which quickly dwindled to a few hundred people. Donations drop off too, but just as things start looking bleakest, new kinds of people, curious about his change in beliefs, start showing up on Sunday mornings. Carlton Pearson died in November 19, 2023 . Russell Cobb writes and teaches at the University of Alberta. (23 minutes) _Russell Cobb_

Act Three

      <description>A girl signs up for a class. A couple hires an accountant. A group of co-workers decides to pool their money and buy a couple of lottery tickets. In the beginning, they're full of hope and optimism — and then something turns. Stories of good ideas gone bad.

Prologue
Paul was a cop. One night he was pulling second shift when he had a perfectly good idea: He'd stretch out in the back seat and take a little nap during his break. He fell right asleep, and slept well until he woke up and realized the funny thing about the back seats of cop cars: The doors don't open from the inside. Paul is author of the book Bad Cop: New York's Least Likely Police Officer Tells All . (8 minutes) _Paul Bacon, Ira Glass_

Act One
It was two months into the tour. Katie Else and the rest of the Riverdance cast had been performing eight shows a week. They decided to pool their money for the Mega-Millions lottery. Lotto fever gripped the cast. They started to genuinely believe they would take home about $2 million each, and quit Riverdance the next day. They took the stage the night of the drawing and pulled off their best performance ever, "For the Lotto!," trying to direct their energy towards the win. An hour later, at the hotel bar, the numbers came in. (17 minutes) _Katie Else, Ira Glass_

Act Two
After years of neglecting their personal finances, Joel and his wife finally decide to sort things out. They hire a tax accountant named Len, whose casual manner is a real comfort, at first. But then, "casual" turns into "drunk" and then it's clear that he's just plain delinquent. Joel tries to take his business elsewhere, but Len refuses to let go of their file. He begs for a second chance, which it seems, came too late. Joel Lovell is executive editor at Pineapple Street Media . (8 minutes) _Joel Lovell_

Act Three
Davy Rothbart was on a 136-city tour appearing on morning TV talk shows to promote his book Found: The Best Lost, Tossed, and Forgotten Items from Around the World . Just before one appearance he had what seemed like a great idea at the time. Without letting the host know, he tested it out, live, on-air. Davy is the creator of Found Magazine and author of the book of essays My Heart Is An Idiot . (6 minutes) _Davy Rothbart_

Act Four
When Elspeth was a girl, she wanted nothing more than her father's attention. He was busy, a doctor, and distant. One day he agrees to put on a volunteer seminar for their church, about his area of expertise: "The Function of the Heart." Elspeth and her best friend are the only two kids who show up, and Elspeth is attentive and engaged, the perfect student. It was an incredible experience for her, the best day she's ever spent with her dad...she thinks. That is, until her mother takes her aside and explains her big mistake. (8 minutes) _Elspeth Carruthers_

      <description>Stories that take place on the edge of civilization, just out of sight.

Prologue
Every city's got a place like this: that weird no man's land on the outskirts of town, with junk yards and landfills. Charlie Gregerson grew up near that stuff, on Chicago's far south side, and he remembers finding debris from famous Louis Sullivan masterpieces in the garbage dump after those buildings were demolished. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Out for a simple pleasure cruise with two friends, Alex Zharov was planning to see Jamaica Bay in New York City. But this end-of-the-day excursion, which should have only lasted 40 minutes, turns into an out-of-control adventure that left him lost, stranded, and bleeding...all within sight of the Empire State Building. Brett Martin reports. (23 minutes) _Brett Martin_

Act Two
In New Orleans, visitors can take a bus tour called "HURRICANE KATRINA: AMERICA'S GREATEST CATASTROPHE," put on by the Gray Line bus company. (The tour is also sometimes called "Hurricane Katrina: America's Worst Catastrophe.") It's designed for out-of-towners, but we asked a local to take the tour and give us their impressions. Cheryl Wagner agreed. (16 minutes) _Cheryl Wagner_

Act Three
The story of the government cracking down on smokestack emissions at a city factory...even though the residents LIKE the emissions. We hear from Jorge Just, who explains the one, magical, special secret about Chicago no one outside Chicago ever believes is true, from Brian Urbaszewski, Director of Environmental Health Programs for the American Lung Association in Chicago; and from Julie Armitage, Manager of Compliance and Enforcement for the Bureau of Air at the Illinois State EPA. (9 minutes)

      <description>Stories about the kinds of chase games that just never end. From the high California desert to a high-end furniture showroom.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks to Adam Stein about the very real cat-and-mouse game between his friends and the vice principal of his high school that preoccupied them throughout their high school careers. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Just near the US-Mexico border, a group of self described "pissed off patriots" called the Minutemen stake out illegal immigrants trying to cross the border. They've got call-signs and walkie-talkies and guns. But not long after they've set up their observation posts, another group shows up to cause trouble. In the dark of night, in the high desert of California, the chase begins. James Spring embeds himself for the night. (21 minutes) _James Spring_

      <description>The right of habeas corpus has been a part of our country's legal tradition longer than we've actually been a country. It means that our government has to explain why it's holding a person in custody. But now, the War on Terror has nixed many of the rules we used to think of as fundamental. At Guantanamo Bay, our government initially claimed that prisoners should not be covered by habeas—or even by the Geneva Conventions—because they're the most fearsome enemies we have. But is that true? Is it a camp full of terrorists, or a camp full of our mistakes?

Prologue
Joseph Margulies, a lawyer for one of the detainees at Guantanamo, explains how the detention facility there was created to be an ideal interrogation facility. Any possible comfort, such as water or natural light, is controlled entirely by the interrogators. (3 minutes) _Joseph Margulies_

Act One
Jack Hitt explains how President Bush's War on Terror changed the rules for prisoners of war and how it is that under those rules, it'd be possible that someone whose classified file declares that they pose no threat to the United States could still be locked up indefinitely—potentially forever!—at Guantanamo.. Clarification : When Seton Hall professor Baher Azmy discusses the classified file of his client, Murat Kurnaz, he is referring to information that had previously been made public and published in the Washington Post . That material has subsequently been reclassified. (26 minutes) _Jack Hitt_

Act Two
Habeas corpus began in England. And recently, 175 members of the British parliament filed a "friend of the court" brief in one of the U.S. Supreme Court cases on habeas and Guantanamo—apparently, the first time in Supreme Court history that's happened. In their brief, the members of Parliament warn about the danger of suspending habeas: "During the British Civil War, the British created their own version of Guantanamo Bay and dispatched undesirable prisoners to garrisons off the mainland, beyond the reach of habeas corpus relief." In London, reporter Jon Ronson, author of Them: Adventures with Extremists , goes in search of what happened. (7 minutes) _Jon Ronson_

Act Three
Although more than 200 prisoners from the U.S. facility at Guantanamo Bay have been released, few of them have ever been interviewed on radio or on television in America. Jack Hitt conducts rare and surprising interviews with two former Guantanamo detainees about life in Guantanamo. (20 minutes) _Jack Hitt_

      <description>Stories about people trying to find new solutions to age-old problems—solutions that sometimes cause problems of their own.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with Andy Woolworth, an executive vice president in charge of new product development at the world's largest manufacturer of mousetraps, Woodstrean Corporation, in Lititz, Pennsylvania. About once a month, Andy is contacted by someone who thinks he's invented a better mousetrap. Ira and he review some of the ideas that seemed particularly bad. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Karen Sosnoski's one-year-old son, Anton, was born with what's known as Mosaic Down Syndrome, a rare condition where some of his cells have the extra chromosome that causes Down syndrome and other cells don't. So as he grows, he could end up having all the health risks and challenges of Downs syndrome...or just a few of them. Through a website , Karen found a kid with the same diagnosis, named Tim Colvin, who was doing really well...perhaps because his mother, Kristy, invented a surprising and unusual way to raise her son. When some people hear about what Kristy did, they're shocked. Karen went to talk to Kristy and Tim about how Tim was raised. (13 minutes) _Karen Sosnoski_

Act Two
Nellie Thomas sold ammunition illegally on the South side of Chicago. He made a good living—in cash. And that was his problem. The money was driving him crazy. He was ashamed to tell his family how he earned it, he was afraid he'd be robbed, and he didn't know how to get rid of it. So he kept it in big black garbage bags which he hid around his house and yard. Then one day, he came up with the perfect way to get rid of the money. Sudhir Alladi Venkatesh tells Nellie's story. Sudhir is a sociology professor at Columbia University and recent author of Off the Books: The Underground Economy of the Urban Poor . (15 minutes) _Sudhir Alladi Venkatesh_

Act Three
Reporter Brett Martin tries to use the tools of modern marketing to invent a new religion...one that would serve all the Americans who don't associate with any particular organized religion. It's a lot of people: Forty-three percent of the country says they don't consider themselves religious (according to a 2002 USA Today/Gallup poll). (11 minutes) _Brett Martin_

Act Four
In San Francisco, Andy Raskin tells a story about the spirit of invention, and the forces that want to stop it...at the dinner table. (8 minutes) _Andy Raskin_

      <description>In this show we return to two radio programs originally broadcast in 1996 and 1997.In one show, listeners came onstage with their letters, which they read aloud.In another, listeners from around the country talked about all the brand new sorts of experiences they were having with this new technology that had entered everyone's lives, the Internet. Each show, in its way, is a kind of time capsule.

Prologue
Ira talks about two live shows that This American Life put on in the early days, both co-hosted by David Hauptschein. One was about letters, and the other was about this then-new phenomenon called the internet.

Act One
Ira and playwright David Hauptschein took out advertisements in Chicago inviting people to come to a small theater with letters they've received, sent or found. People came for two nights, and read their letters onstage. They were old letters. Embarrassing letters. Some were funny. Some were poignant. They told a wide range of stories: A heartfelt letter from prison, a hilariously pretentious job letter sent to the New Yorker magazine, a wringingly sincere teenage "should we be more than friends" letter. (16 minutes) _Ira Glass, David Hauptschein_

Act Two
In this show, at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Ira and David Hauptschein explored this now utterly quaint question: Are people having experiences on the Internet they wouldn't have anywhere else? Several hundred listeners sent in samples of what they were finding on the Internet. A guy offers a girl a late-night tour of Microsoft...and this actually makes him seem hot. A guy finds a website for aluminum ball enthusiasts. And Jennifer Ringley talks about how—and why—she kept a web camera — the Jennicam—running in her dorm room 24 hours a day. (39 minutes) _Ira Glass, David Hauptschein_

      <description>Stories about kids who actually want their parents looking out for them.

Prologue
We play excerpts from the documentary film Troop 1500 . In the film, girl scouts from an Austin, Texas, troop visit their mothers, all of whom are in prison. The girls interview their moms, sometimes asking alarmingly direct questions, and videotape the sessions. The film was directed by Ellen Spiro and Karen Bernstein of Mobilus Media , and aired on PBS. (7 minutes) _Karen Bernstein, Ira Glass, Ellen Spiro_

Act One
When Gene Cheek was ten years old, his mother began dating a black man. It was 1961, in North Carolina. Segregation was in full effect. They all knew it was going to be problematic, even dangerous. But it wasn't until they landed in court that they realized just how unpopular they had become, or how dire the consequences of his mother's love would be. Gene Cheek has written a book about his family called The Color of Love: A Mother's Choice in the Jim Crow South . (29 minutes) _Gene Cheek_

Act Two
Will Seymour reads letters he and his grandmother exchanged when he was in high school. He was miserable at the time—his parents had just gotten divorced and he had no friends—and so was his grandma. So they consoled each other through the mail. Will reads the letters as part of the Mortified series. (10 minutes) _Will Seymour_

Act Three
When Emily Helfgot was ten, her dad was a sex therapist on a call-in radio show, which thoroughly embarrassed her. He also kept a stack of Playboy magazines in their house, in plain sight. So she invented a business with them. A dating service. Her clients? The centerfolds. Thea Chaloner tells the story. (10 minutes) _Thea Chaloner_

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks to Jonathan Gold about the bully in high school who knocked Jonathan and his cello down the stairs one day as he was walking to history class—and why Jonathan felt a sudden surge of satisfaction about this almost three decades later. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass, Jonathan Gold_

Act One
Jon Ronson goes to his high school reunion to try to figure out why his schoolmates—his friends!—threw him in a lake when he was sixteen. The only trouble is, no one at the reunion seems to remember it quite the way he does. Jon is the author of the best-selling books Them and The Men Who Stare at Goats . (16 minutes) _Jon Ronson_

      <description>Original stories from David Sedaris, Jonathan Goldstein, and others, on two animals who don't even seem like they should know each other, much less appear on the same radio show.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with Rosie Schaap about an unlikely love affair between a dog and a parrot, and how the dog betrayed the bird's trust, never to regain it. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass, Rosie Schaap_

Act One
This parrot story began as a journalism school assignment. Then, for reporters Alex Lane and Eric Holm, it became something much bigger. They tell Ira the epic tale of a rare parrot stolen by "Johnny," or John Bryant Davila as he likes to be called now, from the Central Park Zoo in 1999. They say it's the best story they've ever worked on, but after years of telling it to friends and strangers, Alex and Eric aren't always sure of where the facts stop and the embellishment begins. So they decide to go back to the main characters and find out.. (22 minutes) _Eric Holm, Alex Lane_

Act Two
A friend tells Jonathan Goldstein how a trip with a pot-bellied pig ended up revealing his character and making his girlfriend leave. Jonathan Goldstein is the host of the radio show Wiretap on the CBC, where a version of this story originally aired. (14 minutes) _Jonathan Goldstein_

Act Three
David Sedaris reads a new story that explores the age-old question: Can a parrot and a pot-bellied pig find happiness in a world that only wants to pigeon-hole them? David's most recent book is Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim . (12 minutes) _David Sedaris_

      <description>True stories that follow the plotline of the old kid's song"The Cat Came Back."It's the simplest plot in the world: Something you thought was gone forever keeps returning, against all odds.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with producer Alex Blumberg and his parents about a bad dog they once had, and how nothing—not getting hit by cars, attacked by bigger dogs, or being shipped off to live on a farm—could stop this dog from coming home. "The Cat Came Back" is sung by Nedelle Torrisi. (11 minutes) _Alex Blumberg, Ira Glass_

Act One
Dan Savage made a pledge over a decade ago that he hoped would just vanish. But it somehow returns from oblivion. Dan's latest book is The Commitment . (13 minutes) _Dan Savage_

Act Two
Ira talks about a specter who haunts the floor of the United States Senate and won't go away, who keeps showing up on TV and making speeches. That ghostly figure? John Kerry. Ira says seeing him on these days is kind of like bumping into someone you used to date. It's over; it didn't work out, and you don't want to see them anymore. (8 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
Michael Beaumier tells a story about a family member who keeps vanishing and returning. This is an excerpt from Michael's book I Know You're Out There . (17 minutes) _Michael Beaumier_

Act Four
We end this show about people and animals who return against all odds with a story about some people who fear they may not be able to return: New Orleans public housing residents whose homes were damaged by Hurricane Katrina and now are slated for demolition by HUD. New Orleans resident Cheryl Wagner asks who should be more ashamed of themselves: The people who think that the public housing complexes in New Orleans should be torn down, or the ones who think they should stay.

      <description>Can love be taught? A family uses a controversial therapy to train their son to love them. And other stories about the hard and sometimes painful work of loving other people.

Prologue
Hard as it is to believe, during the early twentieth century, a whole school of mental health professionals decided that unconditional love was a terrible thing to give a child. The government printed pamphlets warning mothers against the dangers of holding their kids.

      <description>Recently, the British medical journalThe Lancetpublished an study which updated their estimate of the number of Iraqis who've died since the U.S. invasion. With that in mind, we revisita show we did in 2005about the earlier study published inLancetestimating the number of Iraqi deaths. That study was mostly ignored in the U.S. Alex Blumberg revisits the original study and looks at the new one.

Prologue

Act One
Two years ago, a Johns Hopkins University study published in The Lancet estimated the number of civilian casualties in Iraq. It came up with a number—100,000 dead—that was higher than any other estimate at the time and was mostly ignored. Producer Alex Blumberg tells the remarkable story of what it took to find that number, why we should find it credible and why almost no one believed it.. (37 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

Act Two
Captain Ryan Gist was given a particularly tough assignment in Iraq: To build relationships with a town where U.S. bombs had killed twelve innocent people. But first he has to apologize to the families of those who were killed. We hear the apology, captured on tape by a journalist in Iraq, and talk to Captain Gist about his work there after this incident. (8 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
The Lancet's new study of deaths in Iraq, by the same research team that did the earlier study, yielded an astounding number—650,000 civilian deaths. Producer Alex Blumberg talks to Ira about the debate over this new study. (6 minutes) _Alex Blumberg, Ira Glass_

      <description>A Muslim woman persuades her husband that their family would be happier if they left the West Bank and moved to America. They do, and things are good...until September 11. After that, the elementary school their daughter goes to begins using a textbook that says Muslims want to kill Christians.

Prologue
In the 1930s, the designer of the U.S. Supreme Court made a frieze to adorn the courtroom walls. It depicted eighteen great lawgivers through ages, including Moses, Solon, Confucius...and Muhammad. The only problem is that Islam forbids such portrayals of the prophet. Host Ira Glass talks to Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations , about why the frieze is offensive to Muslims, and what they tried to do about it. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Serry and her husband's love story began in a place not usually associated with romance: The West Bank. That was where the couple met, fell in love and decided to get married. Then Serry, who was American, convinced her Palestinian husband to move to America. She promised him that in America their children would never encounter prejudice or strife of any kind. But things didn't quite work out that way. This American Life contributor Alix Spiegel tells the story. (33 minutes) _Alix Spiegel_

Act Two
The New York advertising agency where Shalom Auslander works got an assignment from the State Department back in 2001: Sell American values to the Muslim world. Now they just have to figure out exactly what to say to millions of people they know absolutely nothing about. Shalom is the author of a book of stories called Beware of God .

      <description>The mysterious hold supers have on their buildings, or that their buildings have on them.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass visits the Upper East Side building in Manhattan where Peter Roach has been the super for about ten years. Peter has a lot of keys. He doesn't know what most of them unlock. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Reporter Jack Hitt tells the story of how he helped organize tenants and threaten a rent strike in a New York City building back in the 1980s. Before long, Bob, the building super became his enemy. The situation got pretty ugly. Mobster ugly. Bob began to brag about how important he was in his native Brazil, how he could kill a person and be immune from prosecution. Only many years later did Jack find out how dangerous Bob really was. (23 minutes) _Jack Hitt_

Act Two
The super in Josh Bearman's Los Angeles building was kind of a needy character. He would sometimes ask Josh to come into his apartment and help him out -- check whether his garbage was being moved by a ghost, for example. Then one day he told Josh a story that involved these elements: a gas station, a beautiful woman, an orchid, a snowman, Indonesia, and a check he'd written for $30,000. It was so crazy, that naturally, Josh believed it. (12 minutes) _Josh Bearman_

Act Three
A man who we're calling "Dennis" inherits his father's job as a landlord of a big apartment building. His dad had warned him that bad tenants could drive even a good man to become heartless, but Dennis vowed that would never happen to him. He's tested on this point when he tries to help a couple that falls behind in their rent. He sets up a payment plan for them, teaches them how to make a budget, helps them with their personal problems. For six years, he stops himself from kicking them out. This story was co-produced by Sonari Glinton. (16 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>An American reporter in Iraq decides to rent a house in a residential Baghdad neighborhood rather than live in a hotel and be an easy target for insurgents. And an eleven-year-old boy figures out an ingenious way to see his dead father again. Big ideas gone amok.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks to an expert stone cutter who makes headstones. One day he got a call from a guy who wanted him to make his headstone in advance, which is not all that uncommon. But on the stone, the man wanted to put pictures of his sons, along with the exact dates of their deaths. The strange thing was, they weren't dead yet. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Radio reporter Adam Davidson went to Iraq to report on the war. He decided that rather than living in some journalist compound in the Green Zone or in a big hotel—places insurgents were more likely to attack—he'd fly under the radar, and keep safe...by renting a house in a residential Baghdad neighborhood. This plan turned out to have some serious flaws—flaws the American military forces were probably all too familiar with. This American Life producer Nancy Updike talked to Adam about his occupation strategy. (27 minutes) _Adam Davidson, Nancy Updike_

Act Two
Ron Mallett was ten years old when his father died unexpectedly of a heart attack. A year later, after picking up a comic book based on H.G. Wells' book The Time Machine, Ron concocted perhaps the world's most complicated plan to try to see his dad again. A half-century later, Dr. Ronald Mallett wrote a book about his plan, called Time Traveler . Josh Gleason reports. (23 minutes) _Josh Gleason_

      <description>An old man in Brooklyn invites some homeless prostitutes into his house on a cold winter night. They never leave. Plus other stories about houses, such as the United States Congress, where the inhabitants don't always act as they should.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks to Randall Bell, who specializes in assessing how tragedy affects real estate. He's found that the market is much quicker to forgive and forget a scandal than the neighbors are. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Joe had lived alone in his big house in Brooklyn for decades. Then one night he saw a few people—prostitutes, actually—shivering outside in the cold, and he opened up his home to them. Pretty soon his upper floors were completely trashed. His house became overrun by the neighborhood's roughest characters, and somehow he couldn't do anything about it. Maherin Gangat reports the story. (23 minutes) _Maherin Gangat_

Act Two
When David Wilcox was eighteen, he set about looking for an apartment in Houston. He had no credit and very little money, but he was determined to move away from home. He finally found a place in the only apartment complex he could afford. After a few disturbing encounters with neighbors—plus a tornado—he realized maybe he needed to think again. (14 minutes) _David Wilcox_

Act Three
There's probably no house more famous for the bad behavior of its denizens than the U.S. House of Representatives. For twelve years, Democrats squirmed under the heel of the Republican majority. Since the 2006 elections, though, they're giving back a bit of what they got, while the new GOP minority complains in a very familiar way. It's the age-old, unwinnable fight: "Who started it?" Producer Alex Blumberg talks to both sides. (13 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

      <description>A man with social anxiety goes through a transformation on a TV game show, a young woman with high ideals has them dashed by a TV game show, and teams compete to solve some of the hardest puzzles in the world, for fun.

Prologue
Ira talks with Bob Harris, a former Jeopardy champion, about how he prepared to go on the program. He turned his living room into a replica of the real-life Jeopardy studio, taped a poster of Alex Trebek, the host of Jeopardy , in the exact spot where the real Alex Trebek stands, and even made a fake buzzer out of a ball point pen and masking tape. He wrote a book about his experiences called Prisoner of Trebekistan . Ira also mentions that there's something special about the act names in this episode. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Roger Dowds won several hundred thousand pounds on the Irish version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire, which is why Ronan Kelly, the host an Irish public radio program, first went to interview him. During their talk together, it became clear that Roger was a very unlikely game show champion. Ronan's story about Roger Dowds first appeared on his own program called Flux . It came to the attention of This American Life after winning a prize at the Third Coast International Audio Festival . (26 minutes) _Ronan Kelly_

Act Two
Every winter, some of the world's best puzzle solvers gather in Boston for the MIT mystery hunt, a competition in which teams of puzzle enthusiasts spend between 24 and 72 straight hours trying to solve what just may be the hardest recreational puzzles in the world. This American Life producer Lisa Pollak hung out with one team (named Dr. Awkward...a palindrome) as they worked towards the ultimate answer, the location of a coin, buried somewhere on the MIT campus. Check out the puzzles from that year's hunt . (13 minutes) _Lisa Pollak_

Act Three
Robin Epstein talks about her old job, as producer and chief question writer on a game show for teen-age girls called Plugged In. It was one of the first shows to air on the Oxygen network, the TV channel for women created by Oprah Winfrey. Robin had hoped that the show could serve as a role model for young women, showing smart teen girls answering tough questions. But in the end, it sort of did the opposite. By the way, the special thing about the act names...they're anagrams—they all contain exactly the same letters, just arranged into different words. They were written for us by one of the people on the Dr. Awkward team at the MIT Mystery hunt, David Ellis Dickerson. (11 minutes) _David Ellis Dickerson, Robin Epstein_

      <description>Stories of proxy fights, proxy arguments, and proxy situations of all kinds.

Prologue
This American Life producer Nancy Updike talks with a man, Eric Molinsky, about a weirdly heated argument he got into with a good friend, over corporate tax loopholes. Midway through, they both stopped to think: Why were they getting so upset over an issue they didn't really care about that much? And then they realized: Eric's ex-girlfriend was a political activist, and Eric's friend's ex-boyfriend was a hedge fund manager. Eric and his friend had had a 20-minute proxy argument on behalf of their exes. Host Ira Glass also talks about how a lot of his opinions about TV are just proxy opinions that he holds on behalf of his wife. (5 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act One
This American Life regular contributor Davy Rothbart talks about the time a friend asked him to make a decision for her that she really had to make for herself: Whether she should have an abortion. Davy is the founder and publisher of Found Magazine and author of a book of short stories, The Lone Surfer of Montana, Kansas . (14 minutes) _Davy Rothbart_

Act Two
Basim, an Iraqi national, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army. He talks with host Ira Glass about the time he had to purposely mistranslate in order to keep a situation from turning violent, as well as the day interpreters became the prime targets for insurgent assassins—even more prized than American soldiers. (22 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
Robert (pictured) had a bad reputation as a kid who didn't do his schoolwork and had little respect for adults. But his best friend, Lilly (holding picture), thought he was misunderstood. After Robert died, Lilly decided to step in and do for him what he could never do for himself: Tell people how great he was. And also tell his teachers how much he'd appreciated their efforts, even though he'd never shown it. Eve Abrams, one of Robert's former teachers and a freelance radio reporter in New York City, tells the story. (12 minutes) _Eve Abrams_

      <description>Stories recorded during our 2007 live tour. Sarah Vowell, David Rakoff, Dan Savage, and other favorite contributors went on the road with us to New York, Boston, Minneapolis, Chicago, Seattle, and Los Angeles; and performed brand-new stories in front of sold-out audiences.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with Jane Espenson—who's written for the TV shows Battlestar Galactica and Gilmore Girls —and with J.J. Abrams—one of the creators of the hit shows Lost , Alias , and Felicity —about how we might be in the midst of another Golden Age of television. (4 minutes) _J. J. Abrams, Jane Espenson, Ira Glass_

Act One
This American Life contributor David Rakoff, who swore off TV in college, returns to it in dramatic fashion: He attempts to watch the same amount of television as the average American—29 hours in one week. David is author, most recently, of the book Don't Get Too Comfortable . (15 minutes) _David Rakoff_

Act Two
Sarah Vowell examines what happens when TV takes on a subject it really has no business exploring at all, but seems fairly obsessed with nonetheless: The Pilgrims. Sarah's most recent book is Assassination Vacation . (10 minutes) _Sarah Vowell_

Act Three
Ira says a few words about what he learned from working on a television show himself and about what it's like to hear your name mentioned casually by a fictional character on a prime time drama. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Four
Regular This American Life contributor Dan Savage, a syndicated sex columnist with possibly the filthiest mouth of anyone you could ever meet, finds a TV program so dirty, so weird, and so perverted that he won't let his son watch it—even though it's a kids' show, made for kids, and broadcast on a network for kids. Dan's most recent book is The Commitment: Love, Sex, Marriage, and My Family (15 minutes) _Dan Savage_

      <description>Stories of sudden fame, quick riches, and the downside of the dream job.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with some real-live NASA astronauts: Cady Coleman , Chris Cassidy , and Marsha Ivins . On average, NASA schedules just a couple of space missions a year. But it employs 95 astronauts. This means that only a tiny percentage of an astronaut's career is actually spent in space, and some never get there. Ira talks with these three astronauts about how they spend the vast majority of their time: on the ground, in an office, doing paperwork. (8 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
This American Life contributor John Hodgman was unexpectedly chosen to be in a series of high-profile Apple Computer commercials (he plays a PC). He tells the story of what happens when celebrity hunts you down and finds you...on your living room couch, pushing 40, and a couple sizes larger than you want to be. John was recorded live during our " What I Learned from Television " tour, before a sold-out audience at Royce Hall in Los Angeles. (12 minutes) _John Hodgman_

Act Two
This American Life producer Alex Blumberg talks with Ed Ugel , who had a very unusual dream job: He bought jackpots from lottery winners. When you win the lottery, your prize is often paid out in yearly installments. And Ed would offer winners a lump sum in exchange for their yearly checks. He's talked with thousands of lottery winners, and the vast majority, he says, wish they'd never won. Ed wrote a book about his years in the "lump sum industry" called Money for Nothing: One Man's Journey through the Dark Side of Lottery Millions . (19 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

Act Three
This American Life contributor Sarah Vowell tells the story of a mapmaker named Charles Preuss who charted the Western Territories with two of American history's legendary explorers—John Charles Fremont and Kit Carson. The maps Preuss made were best sellers and helped open the Western frontier to settlement. But, as he wrote in the diary he kept while in the wilderness, he hated pretty much every minute of the expedition. Actor Dermot Mulroney reads excerpts from Preuss's diary. Sarah Vowell is the author, most recently, of Assassination Vacation . (8 minutes) _Sarah Vowell_

Act Four
Reporter Douglas McGray interviews a college student in California with good grades, an excellent work ethic, but no possible way to get a legal job. She's lived in the U.S. since she was little, but her parents are undocumented; and she is, too. Most of her friends and teachers don't even know. Douglas McGray is a fellow at the New America Foundation . (10 minutes) _Douglas McGray_

      <description>Stories of people trying to recover from damage to their reputations—sometimes caused by others, sometimes self-inflicted.

Prologue
Robyn Forest thought she'd gotten her big break when a magazine assigned her to write about a famous Japanese pop singer. Instead, Robyn ended up on Japanese television denying that she and the singer were having an affair. Host Ira Glass talks with Robyn about how she accidentally ruined her own reputation. (10 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
This American Life producer Sarah Koenig tells a story of the rise and fall of a politician's reputation. Raymond Buckley, a Democratic operative from New Hampshire, was instrumental in his party's success in last fall's midterm elections. He set his sights on becoming the chair of the state Democratic Party. But three months before the election for party chair, one of Buckley's political rivals accused him of one of the worst things that anyone can be accused of. It threatened to destroy not only his career, but his life. Unlike most politicians at the center of a scandal, Buckley was willing to talk about what he went through and how it changed him. (35 minutes) _Sarah Koenig_

Act Two
It's one thing to wonder what other people really think of you. It's quite another to go out and ask them. Writer Gabriel Delahaye asked his closest friends—on tape—what they really think of him, and the answers surprised him. The story of one man's brave quest to face up to his reputation. (10 minutes) _Gabriel Delahaye_

      <description>An updated version of our episode "Habeas Schmabeas," which won a2006 Peabody Award. Listen to aspecial, uncut version.

Prologue
Joseph Margulies, a lawyer for one of the detainees at Guantanamo, explains how the detention facility there was created to be an ideal interrogation facility. Any possible comfort, such as water or natural light, is controlled entirely by the interrogators. (3 minutes) _Joseph Margulies_

Act One
Jack Hitt explains how President Bush's War on Terror changed the rules for prisoners of war and how it is that under those rules, it'd be possible that someone whose classified file declares that they pose no threat to the United States could still be locked up indefinitely—potentially forever!—at Guantanamo.. (30 minutes) _Jack Hitt_

Act Two
Habeas corpus began in England. And recently, 175 members of the British parliament filed a "friend of the court" brief in one of the U.S. Supreme Court cases on habeas and Guantanamo—apparently, the first time in Supreme Court history that's happened. In their brief, the members of Parliament warn about the danger of suspending habeas: "During the British Civil War, the British created their own version of Guantanamo Bay and dispatched undesirable prisoners to garrisons off the mainland, beyond the reach of habeas corpus relief." In London, reporter Jon Ronson, author of Them: Adventures with Extremists , goes in search of what happened. (7 minutes) _Jon Ronson_

Act Three
Although more than 200 prisoners from the U.S. facility at Guantanamo Bay have been released, few of them have ever been interviewed on radio or on television in America. Jack Hitt conducts rare and surprising interviews with two former Guantanamo detainees about life in Guantanamo. (20 minutes) _Jack Hitt_

      <description>For Easter weekend — and the end of Passover! — stories of people struggling to follow the Ten Commandments.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass reads from the Ten Commandments. Not the original Ten Commandments, but some of the newer, lesser-known ones. There's the Miner's Ten Commandments of 1853 , the Ten Commandments of Umpiring , and the Ten Commandments for Math Teachers — just to name a few. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>Four years into the Iraq War, what have we learned? Soldiers, civilians, Iraqis, and Americans talk—and sometimes yell—about what they've learned in the last few years...including how to stay alive and why the aftermath of a war can be the trickiest time of all.

Prologue
There's a 200-person operation based out of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas called the Center for Army Lessons Learned . Host Ira Glass speaks with Colonel Steve Mains, who runs the Center, and with Craig Hayes and Lynn Rolf, two men who answer soldiers' requests for information. They explain what they're learning from soldiers in the field in Iraq, then and passing on to other soldiers. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
This American Life producer Nancy Updike tells the story of Conrad Crane, the head of the U.S. Army Military History Institute . Along with Andrew Terrill, he was commissioned by the Army to look at previous post-war occupations and give advice about how to stabilize and reconstruct post-war Iraq. The booklet they produced , which includes nine pages of detailed instructions on how to occupy Iraq, predicted many of the problems that eventually came to haunt the occupation. Although it was admired by successful commanders in Iraq, including H.R. McMaster, Updike explains why it was ignored by Pentagon officials. (22 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Prologue
Ira speaks with Milt Hileman of the Center for Army Lessons Learned about the single most-requested publication they put out, Soldiers' Handbook: The First 100 Days: Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures . It explains how to avoid getting killed in your first hundred days in Iraq, which is when a disproportionate number of U.S. casualties occur. The information in the booklet came from Iraq vets. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
What lessons are civilians taking from the War? One journalist has said that Americans seem condemned "to relive the prewar debates over and over because they were never thrashed out in the sunlight." In Salt Lake City on May 4, the prewar arguments—and some other arguments as well—were re-argued, on stage, by Salt Lake's liberal mayor Rocky Anderson and conservative radio and TV host Sean Hannity. Scott Carrier attended the event. (13 minutes) _Scott Carrier_

Act Three
For all the discussion in Congress about withdrawing troops, there seems to be very little serious discussion about why, about what'll happen to Iraq once we leave, about responsible ways to withdraw. To understand better these and other rarely-discussed questions about the war, we turned to Washington Post reporter Thomas Ricks in Baghdad. A new edition of his book Fiasco: The American Military Adventure in Iraq was released with an afterword discussing some of these questions. (9 minutes) _Thomas Ricks_

      <description>When he was a teenager, Haider worked in the Iraqi Ministry of Information. He was specially trained to talk to visiting dignitaries and foreign reporters, and he loved his job. It was exciting, and he was treated like a celebrity.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass tells a story about how, when he was in seventh grade, he was over at his best friend's house and saw beer in the fridge. He'd only ever seen beer in fridges on TV; he didn't think it existed in real life. It was a little disturbing. And suddenly, he had to reevaluate what he thought of his friend's family. Valentina Filimonova had a similar experience when, two weeks after she arrived in New York from Ukraine, she went to the drugstore to buy tampons. And Starlee Kine describes how her father learned that there was a whole other way to live his life—after staring at a fish tank. (6 minutes) _Valentina Filimonova, Ira Glass, Starlee Kine_

Act One
When he was a teenager, Haider Hamza worked in the Iraqi Ministry of Information. He was specially trained to talk to visiting dignitaries and foreign reporters, and he loved his job. It was exciting, and he was treated like a celebrity. Then the war broke out, his family fled, his job disappeared, and Haider suddenly had to figure out what to do next: Hide, like his father wanted, or jump into the fray—in one of the most dangerous ways possible. Gideon Yago tells the story. (28 minutes) _Gideon Yago_

Act Two
Filmmaker Tony Hill took his friend Sally Goode, who was born blind, to a place she'd never been before, then taped her trying to figure out where she was. We first heard Hill's story care of our colleagues at the Third Coast International Audio Festival . They got it from the Audible Picture Show . (5 minutes) _Tony Hill_

      <description>Stories about the pitfalls of trying to do the right thing.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks to Tim Jaccard, who used to be a police medic. The calls he hated most were all the same: "Baby not breathing." So in 1998, he helped write the first "safe haven" law, which allows mothers to safely abandon their babies without getting into trouble. Jaccard started the AMT Children of Hope Foundation , and he runs its safe haven program. But even now, there are some babies he just can't save. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Say there's a group of five people standing on a train track, and you're on a train coming toward them. You can save the whole group by pulling a lever and switching to another track, but the catch is that you'll kill another person who's standing on that other track. Do you pull the lever? According to Harvard scientist Mark Hauser , who posed this question to hundreds of thousands of people on the Internet, nine out of 10 people say yes, they would pull the lever. But then, the questions get harder—and the answers much more confusing. It turns out that different parts of our brains make different moral decisions. This story originally aired on the public radio program Radiolab . (11 minutes) _Radiolab_

Act Two
When the U.S. government sent out a call for volunteers—regular, non-military people—to go to Iraq and help rebuild the country, Randy Frescoln signed up. He believed in the cause of the war and in the promise of its mission. He had experience setting up agriculture projects overseas, so was sent to the Sunni Triangle to try to reconstruct the broken economy there. But three months into his yearlong assignment, he comes to a horrible realization: The people he's trying to help hate him. Plus, stories of other people who went to Iraq as "provincial reconstruction team" volunteers. Kiki Munshi, a retired Foreign Service Officer who headed a PRT in the Diyala province speaks to the difficulties she faced as well. Ira interviews her about testimony she gave to Congress about PRTs in Iraq and her personal experience there. Finally, there's Stephanie Miley, an FSO who headed Randy's PRT. She remembers him and understood when he decided to leave, but Stephanie feels that the efforts to improve the state of Iraq are worth it, despite the risk of death. (16 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
Brady Udall tells the story of the time he helped a stranger get his car out of a ditch. In exchange, the man promises to help him any time, for any reason—legal or not. Brady carries the man's card in his wallet; he's reassured that he has such a powerful guy in his corner. Many years later, Brady finally looks him up. Brady is the author of The Miracle Life of Edgar Mint and of the short story collection Letting Loose the Hounds . (25 minutes) _Brady Udall_

      <description>Stories about people taking history into their own hands. We hear from two men in two different wars. One is trying to make a difference in the current war in Iraq. The other is with the CIA at the very end of the Cold War.

Prologue
Dal LaMagna, millionaire and creator of the Tweezerman tweezer, prepares to go to Iraq on a diplomatic mission he invented for himself—despite concern (and mocking) from his own sister. (2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Dal LaMagna made a fortune selling high-quality grooming products. And after retiring, he wanted to do some good in the world. His plan: Curb the violence in Iraq. He thought he could get the Sunni resistance to sit down with Coalition forces to negotiate a cease-fire.

      <description>Stories of what can happen when you go from being a private person to a public face.

Prologue
David Iserson tried to lay low in junior high, staying out of sight to keep from getting teased and bullied. But then he starred in a local TV commercial for his father's furniture store, and all of a sudden everyone knew about him...in a bad way. Classmates would quote his lines back to him and snicker. Random people would see him on the street and start laughing. (9 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Rachel North was on a train that got blown up during the London subway bombings. After writing a very popular blog about her experience and her recovery afterward, Rachel became a spokeswoman for a survivors' group. Then conspiracy theorists—who believed that there were no bombings and that the whole thing was a cover-up by the British government—started attacking her online, saying she was a spy...or a plant by the police...or, worse, that she didn't exist at all. Jon Ronson tells her story. Jon writes books, hosts radio shows, and produces BBC documentaries—all of which you can check out on his website . A version of this story appeared on his BBC Radio Four series Jon Ronson On... . Rachel North has written a book about her experience, called Out of the Tunnel . (21 minutes) _Jon Ronson_

Act Two
Anthony Pico was a foster kid for most of his life. His mother was a crack addict who abandoned him, and he bounced around from house to house, relative to relative. But unlike a lot of foster kids, he had an amazing ability to talk about his life eloquently. He started getting invited to child welfare conferences, presenting to social workers and politicians and bureaucrats about problems with the foster care system. He got so good at it that he turned into a professional foster kid. Reporter Doug McGray tells Anthony's story. Doug McGray is a fellow at the New America Foundation . (20 minutes) _Douglas McGray_

Act Three
Joe Lockhart was press secretary for President Bill Clinton. He recently told stories from his time on the job—live onstage at a performance space in New York City called The Moth , where regular people share stories about their lives—in front of a boisterous crowd. It turns out that Presidential press secretaries CAN have personality. Thanks to The Moth for the recording. (6 minutes) _Joe Lockhart_

      <description>There are umpteen TV shows about solving murders, endless whodunits in bookstores. But what happens to the people left behind after the detectives close the case? Three stories about children trying to figure out how to live normally after their parents have died.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks to Rachel Howard, whose father, Stan, was murdered when she was 10 years old. His case was never solved. And like a lot of people whose family members have been killed, she tried for a long time to find the killer. But after a while, she gave up. And she's comfortable with that—which sometimes makes fellow survivors decidedly uncomfortable. Rachel wrote a book, The Lost Night , about her father's murder. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass, Rachel Howard_

Act One
Jason Minter lived through the worst trauma you could imagine: He was at a friend's house, a gun pressed to his head, while his mother and another woman were raped and shot to death in the next room by robbers. He was six. And even though he saw a series of therapists as he grew up, he's never been able to feel anything about what happened. He's never even cried about it. So almost 30 years after the crime, Jason decides to make a documentary, to revisit every aspect of his mother's murder, in hopes that he'll connect to what happened, and to her, in some way. (30 minutes) _Jason Minter_

Act Two
A story about a mother who wants to commit suicide and a son who dutifully helps her do it—even though his mother is a happy, healthy, independent person. How did they manage to pull it off? Practice, practice, practice. (16 minutes) _Brett Martin_

      <description>Stories of the unintended consequences of market forces.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks to reporter John Bowe about the story of John Nash Pickle, who ran a company in Tulsa, Oklahoma that made steel tanks used in the oil industry. According to 52 Indian men whom Pickle hired and brought to America, Pickle was trying to compete with foreign companies, doing something most companies never try. Instead of simply opening a factory overseas with cheap labor, the men say, Pickle decided to run an overseas factory with cheap labor...on American soil...inside his own Tulsa Oklahoma plant. (3 minutes) _John Bowe, Ira Glass_

Act One
We continue the story of John Pickle. He hires skilled, experienced welders in India and brings them to the United States. He takes their passports, barely feeds them, pays them half the minimum wage. And when the men protest, Pickle insists he's helping them—doing them a favor in fact. John Bowe's book, in which this story appears, is called Nobodies: Modern American Slave Labor and the Dark Side of the New Global Economy . (32 minutes) _John Bowe_

Thanh Tan was a TV reporter in Boise, Idaho, when her boss passed along what seemed like a hot news tip: A sex offender was working with kids at a local ice rink, as a hockey referee. But when she looked into it, she found out the crime was more than a decade old. Plus, the guy's statutory rape charge had been dismissed by a judge. So she never did the story. But her closest TV news competitor ran with it, making it "exclusive" breaking news, for days. Thanh tells the story of how it got on the air, and how it affected everyone involved. Thanh's story was co-produced by Dmae Roberts. (23 minutes) _Dmae Roberts, Thanh Tan_

Reporter Scott Gurian tells what happens next. (4 minutes) _Scott Gurian_

      <description>A 79-year-old woman, Mary Ann, dies in Los Angeles. She's lived alone for decades. No one knows her—or her next of kin. There's a body to be buried, a house full of stuff to get rid of.

Prologue
Yvonne has lived by herself for 12 years, ever since her last child moved out. She eats dinner by herself, takes care of the house on her own, and usually spends most holidays alone. She explains why she's perfectly happy this way—and has no desire to live with anyone else. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Mary Ann was an elderly woman living by herself in Los Angeles County. She wasn't married, didn't have children, wasn't in touch with any of her family. When she became sick and went to the hospital, the only contact she had was Sue, the woman who delivered her prescriptions from the pharmacy. Then, Mary Ann died. There was a body to be buried, a house full of stuff to get rid of—but no family or friends to deal with it all. Luckily, there was Emily, an investigator for the Los Angeles Public Administrator's Office. It's her job to take care of the remains of lives like Mary Ann's. Eric Klinenberg reports the story. He's a sociologist, whose most recent book is Going Solo: The Extraordinary Rise and Surprising Appeal of Living Alone . (15 minutes) _Eric Klinenberg_

Act Two
Growing up, Clevins Browne moved all over New York with his mother, in different apartments and homeless shelters. But that all changed when he was 12, and they got an apartment in a public housing complex in Brooklyn. Then, when he had just turned 15, his mom collapsed in pain while they were watching TV at home. Clevins called 911, and then hid in the closet, so he wouldn't be taken away by child services. He stayed in the apartment by himself—with no money, hardly any food—until his mother came home from the hospital: Five months later. Clevins talked to This American Life producer Sarah Koenig, about how he survived. (22 minutes) _Sarah Koenig_

Act Three
When she was in kindergarten, Jennifer, along with her brother and mother,
was held hostage by an armed gunman for four days. Their father was a drug
dealer and had disappeared with a bunch of cocaine that belonged to someone
else. The gunman had been sent to hold the family hostage until he returned
the drugs. But the gangsters didn't count on Jennifer's mother being so
tough—frightening enough, in fact, to almost make the guy leave. And not
only that: Her mother was so composed, that Jennifer and her brother never
even knew they were being held hostage. (14 minutes) _Jennifer Schaller_

Prologue
Ira Glass talks to This American Life Producer Jane Feltes about
a recent date she was set up on by a friend. The date was awful—the guy
seemed stoned the whole time. But worse than a wasted evening was the
thought: what must her friend think of her if he's setting her up with
this guy? (5 minutes) _Jane Feltes_

Act One
Miriam and her husband were development workers in Afghanistan. They'd had a whirlwind romance themselves, so when they heard that their driver was in love, but didn't have enough money to propose to the girl, they made a grand romantic gesture: They gave him $10,000 to pay for the dowry and the wedding. It was a move they probably should have known wouldn't work out so well. Gregory Warner reports. (16 minutes) _Greg Warner_

Act Two
Chaya Lipschutz, an Orthodox Jewish woman from Brooklyn, donated her kidney to a stranger. After that, she decided to spend all her time trying to match up potential donors with kidney patients. It's incredibly hard to make a match, and for a year, she had no success. Then, she gets her first break: Her brother's going to donate. For Chaya, a single, middle-aged woman who was supposed to get married decades ago like everyone else in her community, being a kidney matchmaker has become an obsession. She needs this surgery to succeed. Reporter Mary Robertson and This American Life Producer Sarah Koenig recorded Chaya and her brother as the transplant date approached. (19 minutes) _Sarah Koenig_

Act Three
Elna Baker reads her story about the time she worked at the giant toy store, FAO Schwarz. Her job was to sell these lifelike "newborns" which were displayed in a "nursery" inside the store. When the toys become the hot new present, they begin to fly off the shelves. When the white babies sell out, white parents are faced with a choice: Will they go for an Asian, Latino, or African-American baby instead? What happens is so disturbing that Elna has a hard time even telling it. (16 minutes) _Elna Baker_

Plus other people speaking their minds in very tough rooms.

Prologue
Thanksgiving 2002, the Ohm family's dinner conversation turned to the recent terrorist attacks.

This story will be included in Rosie's upcoming collection of stories, entitled Drinking With Men . (12 minutes) _Rosie Schaap_

Act Three
Producer Jane Feltes spends a day with two young Mormons, on mission to possibly the least receptive environment they could find...the Upper West Side of Manhattan. (9 minutes) _Jane Feltes_

      <description>The true story of little-known rooms in the New York City Board of Education building. Teachers are told to report there instead of their classrooms. No reason is usually given.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with a veteran Human Resources administrator about what it's like to fire people, and why it helps if you don't actually use the word "fire." (7 minutes)

Act One
We hear from New York City school teachers about a secret room in the New York City Board of Education building. Teachers are told to report there, and when they arrive, they find out they're under investigation for something. They have to wait in this room all day, every day, until the matter is cleared up. They call this bureaucratic purgatory "the rubber room." Some teachers have been stuck in it for years. This story was produced by Joe Richman, Samara Freemark, and Anayansi Diaz Cortes of Radio Diaries . We first heard about the rubber room from a documentary by Jeremy Garrett. There's a trailer at rubberroommovie.com . Update: in 2010 the City and the teacher's union came to an agreement that will close the Rubber Room. (23 minutes) _Joe Richman_

Act Two
American cities have gone through a massive wave of gentrification in the last few decades. To some people, it's not a natural ebb and flow of the real estate market, but a plot, by rich, mainly white people, to take over the neighborhoods of poor, mainly black people. This American Life producer Jon Jeter reports on how, in neighborhoods all over the country, the plot has a name, "The Plan," and most people you talk to know about it. (11 minutes)

Act Three
Reporter Charles Siebert talks with Ira about retirement homes for Chimpanzees. Yes, retirement homes for Chimpanzees. There are thousands of aging chimps in the US: Retired chimp actors, ex-research subjects, abandoned pets. They can't be put back in the wild since they don't know how to survive there. Charles Siebert visited many of the facilities where they're housed, often in rooms, with TV's and 3 meals a day. He's writing a book about his experiences called Humanzee . (11 minutes)

She visits Room 211 in her school, where her fifth grade class met, and looks at her old books, thinks about what happened there. She says she knows that decades from now, she won't even remember most of what's happening to her this year, in seventh grade, and that makes her sad. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One

      <description>In 1912 a four-year-old boy named Bobby Dunbar went missing in a swamp in Louisiana. Eight months later, he was found in the hands of a wandering handyman in Mississippi. In 2004, Bobby Dunbar's granddaughter discovered a secret beneath the legend of her grandfather's kidnapping, a secret whose revelation would divide her own family, bring redemption to another, and become the answer to a third family's century-old prayer.

Prologue
Ira Glass plays the song "Mystery of the Dunbar's Child" by Richard "Rabbit" Brown. It describes Bobby Dunbar's disappearance and recovery and the trial of his kidnapper, all of which was front page news from 1912 to 1914. Almost a century after it happened, Bobby Dunbar's granddaughter, Margaret Dunbar Cutright, was looking into her grandfather's disappearance and found that the truth was actually more interesting than the legend. And a lot more troubling. (1 minutes) _Tal McThenia_

Act One
Reporter Tal McThenia tells the first half of Margaret's story. Everyone in her family knew the legend. Her grandfather went missing in a swamp in Louisiana, and was found 8 months later in Mississippi, in the hands of a wandering handyman named William Walters. But then another woman came forward and claimed the boy as hers. There was a big trial, and the boy was awarded to the Dunbars. In 1999, Margaret's father gave her a scrapbook full of newspaper clippings from the period. A lot of the clippings didn't match up exactly with her family's legend. So Margaret went on a quest to learn as much as she could, to small town libraries and archives all through the south, and eventually, to the living children of the "other mother," a woman named Julia Anderson. Her family had their own legend about the kidnapping. But in the Anderson version, Julia's son Bruce was the boy who was kidnapped, and it was Margaret's family, the Dunbars, who kidnapped him. (23 minutes)

Act Two
Tal McThenia's story continues. Margaret meets the living relatives of the kidnapper, William Walters, discovers a long lost court file with lots of answers, and finally arrives at an incontrovertible truth, which, depending on your point of view, is either very troubling, or the answer to your prayers. Margaret Dunbar Cutright and Tal McThenia co-authored a book about the Bobby Dunbar story called A Case For Solomon . Tal discusses his experience with creating the radio and book versions in this article in The Huffington Post . (32 minutes)

      <description>Stories of the Bush Administration, its unique style of asserting presidential authority, and its quest to redefine the limits of presidential power.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with Yale law professor Jack Balkin about what he calls the Bush Administration's "lawyering style," a tendency to fight as hard as it can, on all fronts, to get what it wants. Ira also plays tape from a news conference with New York Senator Charles Schumer , in which he takes the Justice Department to task for refusing to pay death benefits to the families of two auxiliary policemen who were killed in the line of duty, even though federal law grants those benefits. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Ira Glass tells the story of a little-known treaty dispute with far-reaching ramifications for our understanding of executive power. The dispute is between the President and one of his appointees...to the International Boundary Commission with Canada. This little-known commission carried out its function without fanfare or incident for over a hundred years, until a couple of retirees in Washington State built a wall in their backyard and, quite literally, set off an international incident. (23 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
This American Life contributor Jack Hitt uncovers a strange practice within the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service. If a foreign national marries a U.S. citizen and schedules an interview for a green card, but the U.S. citizen dies before the interview takes place, the foreign national is scheduled for deportation with no appeal—even if the couple has children who are U.S. citizens. Jack talks with Brent Renison , a lawyer who's representing over 130 people in this situation, mostly widows, who are seeking to overturn the Immigration Service's rule. (20 minutes) _Jack Hitt_

Act Three
Ira Glass interviews Charlie Savage , a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for the Boston Globe , who's written a book called Takeover: The Return of the Imperial Presidency and the Subversion of American Democracy about the ways the Bush Administration claims executive powers that other presidents haven't claimed. Charlie talks with Ira about the current candidates for President and their views on the scope of executive power. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass, Charlie Savage_

      <description>It’s the late 1960s, and a California TV repairman named Bob sees an opportunity to help people cheat death with the new science of cryonics. But freezing dead people isn’t easy. And apologizing for the mistakes you make along the way? Even harder.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks about the way most political apologies go, and chats with a man named Derek Jones about similar sorts of apologies among preteen girls and King David, in the Old Testament. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
In the late 1960s, a California TV repairman named Bob Nelson joined a group of enthusiasts who believed they could cheat death with a new technology called cryonics. But freezing dead people so scientists can reanimate them in the future is a lot harder than it sounds. Harder still was admitting to the family members of people Bob had frozen that he'd screwed up. Sam Shaw reports. (42 minutes) _Sam Shaw_

Act Two
There's a famous William Carlos Williams poem called "This is Just to Say." It's about, among other things, causing a loved one inconvenience and offering a non-apologizing apology. It's only three lines long, you've probably read it...the one about eating the plums in the icebox. Producer Sean Cole explains that this is possibly the most spoofed poem around. We asked some of our regular contributors to get into the act. Sarah Vowell, David Rakoff, Starlee Kine, Jonathan Goldstein, Shalom Auslander and Heather O'Neill all came up with their own variations of Williams's classic lines. _Shalom Auslander, Sean Cole, Jonathan Goldstein, Starlee Kine, David Rakoff, Sarah Vowell_

      <description>A special program about the housing crisis produced in a special collaboration withNPR News. We explain it all to you. What does the housing crisis have to do with the turmoil on Wall Street? Why did banks make half-million dollar loans to people without jobs or income? And why is everyone talking so much about the 1930s?

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with an NPR business and economics correspondent about two gatherings he attended—one at the Ritz Carlton and one at a community college in Brooklyn. The first was an awards dinner for finance professionals who created the mortgage-based financial instruments that nearly brought down the global economic system. The other was a non-profit conference for people facing foreclosure. Ira explains that today's show lays out how the finance guys and the people facing foreclosure are connected by a chain of middlemen, and that together, they all brought about the current housing and credit crisis. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
This American Life producer Alex Blumberg teams up with NPR's Adam Davidson for the entire hour to tell the story—the surprisingly entertaining story—of how the U.S. got itself into a housing crisis. They talk to people who were actually working in the housing, banking, finance and mortgage industries, about what they thought during the boom times, and why the bust happened. And they explain that a lot of it has to do with the giant global pool of money. (30 minutes) _Alex Blumberg, Adam Davidson, Planet Money_

Act Two
Alex and Adam's story continues. (23 minutes) _Alex Blumberg, Adam Davidson, Planet Money_

      <description>A lawyer in the Justice Department gets the professional opportunity of a lifetime: To be the lead prosecutor in one of the first high-profile terrorist cases since 9/11. But things go badly for him.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass recalls the case of the so-called Detroit Sleeper Cell—four men, arrested in the weeks after 9/11, accused of plotting terrorist attacks. Ira explains that the entire program will be devoted to the story of the man who prosecuted the case...an up-and-coming prosecutor in the Department of Justice, Richard G. Convertino. (1 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Reporter Petra Bartosiewicz tells the first half of Rick Convertino's story. The Detroit Sleeper case was one of the earliest Justice Department victories in the war on terror. But that victory was overturned, and you could argue that the thing that overturned it was that most banal yet powerful of forces: Office politics. (29 minutes) _Petra Bartosiewicz_

Act Two
Reporter Petra Bartosiewicz's story continues. Tensions between Rick and his bosses at the Justice Department escalate: They demote him, he sues them, they put him on trial for criminal misconduct, in the very same federal court house where we won the Sleeper Cell case. Petra is writing a book on this and other Justice Department cases in the war on terror called The Best Terrorists We Could Find . (26 minutes) _Petra Bartosiewicz_

      <description>Does the truth always come out? Of course not! Though sometimes it comes out in the most uncomfortable ways imaginable. Stories of concealed truths bubbling to the surface, including a brand-new, unpublished story by fiction writer and filmmakerEtgar Keret.

Prologue

Act One
Alex Blumberg and Adam Davidson recount the 36-hour period, two weeks ago, when the credit markets froze. Plus, what it's like now for businesses to get short-term loans, and how the hardship is spreading to every sector of the economy. (16 minutes) _Alex Blumberg, Adam Davidson, Planet Money_

Act Two
One more confusing financial product that's bringing down the global economy.

These are "credit default swaps." Alex explains. (19 minutes) _Alex Blumberg, Planet Money_

Act Three
Ira talks with Michael Greenberger, a former commodities regulator, who tells the story of when it was decided not to regulate credit default swaps.

      <description>Stories about people trying to find new solutions to age-old problems—solutions that sometimes cause problems of their own.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with Andy Woolworth, an executive vice president in charge of new product development at the world's largest manufacturer of mousetraps, Woodstream Corporation, in Lititz, Pennsylvania. About once a month, Andy is contacted by someone who thinks he's invented a better mousetrap. He and Ira review some of the ideas that seemed particularly bad. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Karen Sosnoski's one-year-old son, Anton, was born with what's known as Mosaic Down Syndrome , a rare condition where some of his cells have the extra chromosome that causes Down syndrome and other cells don't. So as he grows, he could end up having all the health risks and challenges of Down syndrome...or just a few of them. Through a website, Karen found a kid with the same diagnosis, named Tim Colvin, who was doing really well...perhaps because his mother, Kristy, invented a surprising and unusual way to raise her son. When some people hear about what Kristy did, they're shocked. Karen went to talk to Kristy and Tim about how Tim was raised. (14 minutes) _Karen Sosnoski_

Act Two
Looked at one way, the current flailing economy is a victim of invention—Wall Street invention. Investors and banks and brokers created all sorts of stuff the world would've been better off without. In the aftermath, Democrats have blamed Republicans for the mess, and, naturally, Republicans have blamed Democrats. Ira talks to Charles Duhigg , whose been covering the subprime mortgage crisis for The New York Times , to find out who we should really be mad at. (10 minutes) _Charles Duhigg, Ira Glass_

Act Three
Nellie Thomas sold ammunition illegally on the South side of Chicago. He made a good living—in cash. And that was his problem. The money was driving him crazy. He was ashamed to tell his family how he earned it, he was afraid he'd be robbed, and he didn't know how to get rid of it. So he kept it in big black garbage bags which he hid around his house and yard. Then one day, he came up with the perfect way to get rid of the money. Sudhir Alladi Venkatesh tells Nellie's story. Sudhir is a sociology professor at Columbia University and author of Off the Books: The Underground Economy of the Urban Poor . (15 minutes) _Sudhir Alladi Venkatesh_

Act Four
To deal with the financial crisis, our own government has also had to reinvent itself, with questionable consequences. This American Life producer Alex Blumberg and NPR's financial reporter Adam Davidson talk to Brad Setser, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations who used to work at the U.S. Treasury. Together they explain what happens when the government reinvents itself as a bank—and not necessarily a successful bank. Alex and Adam are part of an NPR's Planet Money project. (6 minutes) _Alex Blumberg, Adam Davidson, Planet Money_

      <description>This American Lifegoes to Pennsylvania, a battleground within a battleground, to figure out why, and how, John McCain and Barack Obama both think they can win there. And we get to know the ordinary people who've become the candidates' most forceful foot soldiers.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass goes to a McCain rally in Lehigh, PA, outside of Allentown. Obama has double-digit leads over McCain in almost every poll. So why does McCain still think he has a shot? (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
In Scranton, there's a "Citizens for McCain" office. But really, it's a "Democrats for McCain" office; flipping Democrats is vital if McCain is going to win. Producer Nancy Updike spent some time with these anti-Obama Democrats, who apparently have a message that's pitch perfect for their fellow disgruntled party members. (9 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Two
While McCain gathers stray Democrats, Obama is trying to find new ones—in the reddest part of the state. To do that, his campaign has launched enormous registration drives, especially among college students. Producer Sarah Koenig followed registration workers around State College, home to Penn State University, to see how they were doing. (13 minutes) _Sarah Koenig_

Act Three
No one much likes to talk about it out loud, but everyone knows it's true: There are a lot of people out there who say they won't vote for Obama because he's black. To fight this problem, Richard Trumka, secretary treasurer of the AFL-CIO, has been traveling around the country giving a speech to fellow union members. It ends with a plea: You must stand up, and deal with race directly. Talk about it. Producer Lisa Pollak spent a month hanging out with union members, eavesdropping on their conversations, to see if Trumka's directive was working. (17 minutes) _Lisa Pollak_

Act Four
We continue our story about voter registration in State College, where there are only a few days left until the registration deadline. (7 minutes) _Sarah Koenig_

Act Five
Nancy Updike's story about Democrats for McCain continues. (10 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act One
Studs Terkel , the Chicago reporter who recorded oral histories of ordinary Americans, died last week. We assembled a collection of his work from his Hard Times radio series, in which people talk about their experiences during the Depression—how everyone simultaneously became poor, regardless of their class. You can listen to more of Studs Terkel's work here . (32 minutes) _Studs Terkel_

Act Two
Ira talks to Rev. Donald Sharp, of Faith Tabernacle Church in Chicago. Reverend Sharp, who is black, served in the segregated armed forces during World War II. Now, he sees Obama’s election very differently than his children and grandchildren do. They're ecstatic, while he can't shake his suspicion that racism will persist in this country. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
Sara was raised in a fancy suburban neighborhood with strict parents who liked to flaunt their wealth—with his and hers Porsches, for instance. But when Sara was 12, her mother and father sat her down in the den with her siblings, and told them that their father had done a terrible thing, and their lives were about to change forever. Sara told this story at The Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York. (12 minutes) _Upright Citizens Brigade_

      <description>A man in Pakistan wants to break his friend out of prison. He buys him an amulet that supposedly has the power to protect anyone from harm. But just to be on the safe side, he decides to test the amulet by trying it out first. On a chicken.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass point out that it's not enough this time of year that we eat millions of turkeys. Someone also went to the trouble to make up a song about turkeys getting the supernatural power to play baseball. And of course, we play you this song. (2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Greg Warner was living in Pakistan, on the border of Afghanistan, when he met a man—a tough guy, former smuggler—who wanted to break his friend out of prison. He'd bought an expensive amulet, to keep his friend safe during the breakout. But he wanted to test out the amulet first. On a chicken. So Greg and the man and Greg's translator go up into the hills, put the amulet on the chicken, and start shooting. Greg is a reporter based in Afghanistan. (13 minutes) _Greg Warner_

Act Two
Kathie Russo's husband was Spalding Gray , who was best known for delivering monologues onstage—like "Monster in a Box," and "Swimming to Cambodia." On January 10, 2004, he went missing. Witnesses said they saw him on the Staten Island Ferry that night. Two months later, his body was pulled out of the East River. Kathie tells the story of the night he disappeared, and about how, in the weeks following, she and each of their three children were visited by a bird, who seemed to be delivering a message to them. (10 minutes) _Spalding Gray, Kathie Russo_

Act Three
Working in a poultry processing plant is one of the most unpleasant jobs you can get in this country. It's low-paid, dangerous and difficult. Barely any poultry plants are represented by a union, especially in the South, where most of the plants are located. So worker rights advocates rely in large part on the church to help them organize workers. And in the past few years, they've been trying something new: They've been using the church to intervene with company management in a very, very personal way. This American Life producer Sarah Koenig tells the story of how one organizer tried this method with a manager at a company called Case Farms, and a plant they have in Morganton, North Carolina. You can learn more in the film Mississippi Chicken , a documentary about poultry factory workers in Canton, Mississippi. (15 minutes) _Sarah Koenig_

Act Four
Wayne Curtis has been puzzling over an unexplained meteorological phenomenon involving chickens...a riddle that's nearly two centuries old. Wayne is the author, most recently, of And A Bottle of Rum: A History of the New World in Ten Cocktails . (6 minutes) _Wayne Curtis_

Act Five
A short story about an orthodox Jewish man who dies on the operating table and goes to heaven. Where he meets God. Who has way more feathers than he expected. The story is from Shalom Auslander's book, Beware of God . Shalom is also the author of a memoir, Foreskin's Lament . (10 minutes) _Shalom Auslander_

      <description>Stories of people who ruin things for everyone else...or who are accused of that. Like the San Diego parents who didn't vaccinate their child for measles.

Prologue
A bad apple, at least at work, can spoil the whole barrel. And there's research to prove it. Host Ira Glass talks to Will Felps , a professor at Rotterdam School of Management in the Netherlands, who designed an experiment to see what happens when a bad worker joins a team. Felps divided people into small groups and gave them a task. One member of the group would be an actor, acting either like a jerk, a slacker or a depressive. And within 45 minutes, the rest of the group started behaving like the bad apple. (12 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Measles cases are higher in the U.S. than they've been in a decade, mostly because more and more nervous parents are refusing to vaccinate their kids. Contributing Editor Susan Burton tells the story of what happened recently in San Diego, when an unvaccinated 7-year-old boy returned home from a trip to Switzerland, bringing with him the measles. By the end of the ordeal, 11 other children caught the disease, and more than 60 kids had to be quarantined. (22 minutes) _Susan Burton_

Act Two
Comedian Mike Birbiglia talks about the time he ruined a cancer charity event, by giving the worst performance of his life. (Here's a hint: He improvised. About cancer.) (10 minutes) _Mike Birbiglia_

Act Three
There's this haven on the U.S. railroad—the Amtrak Quiet Car. You can't yammer on your cell phone in the Quiet Car, or yuck it up with your friends, or even talk above a murmur. For This American Life Producer Nancy Updike, who commutes between New York and Washington, D.C., it's bliss. But then Nancy began to notice that the more she rode the Quiet Car, the more she was becoming like an enforcer in a fascist fraternity. (8 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

      <description>This American Lifespends several days ina mallin suburban Tennessee, to document life in the mall during the run-up to Christmas. Also, a rift in a national association of professional Santas—the Amalgamated Order of Real Bearded Santas (yes, there is such a group).

Prologue
Most media stories set in shopping malls don't  really tell you much about what it feels like for the people who work in a big retail operation, or for the people who hang out at the mall. Because the mall's more than just sales. Today’s show begins at a table in the food court, near Sbarro’s, in the Cool Springs Galleria, outside Nashville. That’s where Ira Glass found Nick, Cheyenne, Natalie and Chase – teenagers hanging out, killing time before a movie. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
We meet Russell, 19, the best mobile phone salesman in the mall — and possibly anywhere. His talent for sales is matched only by those of his girlfriend, Chandler, 18, a waitress. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Yes, some stores are going out of business in the Cool Springs Galleria, but it's just two stores. We talk to staff at one store that’s closing down, and at another, in the food court, where business is great. That’s maybe the most surprising thing about how this recession is playing out — that some stores are doing just fine. (10 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
A tale of two Santas. There's Tim Conaghan, a full-time professional Santa with a big belly and a real flowing white beard. And there's Santa Nick—he too has a belly and real white beard. But the story of Santa Tim and Santa Nick is not like most uplifting Christmas parables. Instead, it's about two men, very much alike, who came to lead rival factions in a bitter Santa civil war, and came themselves to be arch enemies. Josh Bearman reports on the political schism that's overtaken the Amalgamated Order of Real Bearded Santas. (27 minutes) _Josh Bearman_

Act Four
In a part of the mall no shoppers ever see, there's a snug, dark little room with 43 TV screens, one for each of the cameras in the hallways and parking lots, the roof and the loading dock. We hang out with the security people who work in there, seeing what they see. (7 minutes) _Wendy Dorr, Ira Glass_

      <description>On the eve of Barack Obama's inauguration, we sent reporters out all over the country to talk to people about how they're feeling about this new president. Do they believe things will change? Do they think there'll be changes in their own lives? From dozens of hours of interviews, at a Marine Corps base and a button factory, at a New Orleans bar and a Florida town that used to be a stronghold for the Ku Klux Klan, we heard opinions about what would happen in America after the ceremony on January 20th, 2009.

Prologue
Back in November, two weeks after he was elected president, Barack Obama delivered a pre-taped speech to an international conference on global warming that was convened in Los Angeles by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. It wasn't Obama's most important speech, but the effect it had on the audience was profound—mostly because they heard it through the haze of the last eight years. Host Ira Glass talks about how so many people right now are having these ding-dong-the-witch-is-dead moments. And how the entire country is poised for change, welcome or not. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
The newspaper Military Times did a survey of 2000 active duty servicemen and women, asking them about the new president. Presented with the statement, "As president, Barack Obama will have my best interests at heart," 36 percent agreed...43 percent disagreed. Reporter Peter Biello talks to marines from Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, NC, as they were getting their hair trimmed at the Pro-Kutz Barbershop across the street from the base. And This American Life Producer Nancy Updike visits the office of a veterans' organization called the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. (9 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Two
In this act, kids from the after-school literacy program "826" in Brooklyn, Los Angeles, Chicago and Ann Arbor read letters they wrote to Barack Obama. The letters are part of a book the kids published, called Thanks and Have Fun Running the Country . The book is available now from the McSweeney's website and all proceeds, every penny from the book will go directly to the 826 writing centers across the country. (3 minutes) _826 Literacy Program_

Act Three
When Barack Obama chose Rick Warren of Saddleback Church to give a prayer at his inauguration, gay and lesbian groups cried foul, because of Warren's past remarks about homosexuality and gay marriage. But Rick Warren's constituents—Christian conservatives—also got angry. Ira talks to Dr. Joel Hunter, who's having déjà vu over the whole thing. He's a conservative pastor who Obama chose to give the benediction at the Democratic National Convention. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Four
Well over two years ago, long before the country chose Barack Obama...a company called Tigereye Design in Greenville, Ohio chose him. The owners liked Obama as a candidate and they approached him and asked if they could make buttons and posters and yard signs for the campaign and its online store. If Barack Obama could do for the economy what he did for Tigereye, we would all be very lucky. This American Life Producer Lisa Pollak dropped by the factory to watch them crank out more merchandise, just a week before Inauguration Day. (5 minutes) _Lisa Pollak_

Act Five
Barack Obama's transition team made it clear this week that the incoming president plans to order the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp on his first full day in office. It's also likely that he'll immediately suspend the military commissions held there—the special courts the military set up in Guantanamo that have been widely criticized as unfair to the detainees. This American Life Producer Sarah Koenig talked to one of the military lawyers currently defending a Guantanamo detainee about all this—what's going on there, and what should happen next. (9 minutes) _Sarah Koenig_

Act Six
We asked reporters all over the country to go out and talk to people about what they're thinking as Barack Obama gets ready to take office. We got dozens of hours of interviews. We play you voices recorded by Davy Rothbart in Central Michigan; Barrett Golding of Hearing Voices , in Helena, Montana; Mia Frederick with WMMT in Western Kentucky; Glynn Washington of Snap Judgement Radio in Oakland; Katie Reckdahl and Eve Abrams in New Orleans; Michael Olson in Austin, Texas; and Bryan Parras with Nuestra Palabra in Houston. (16 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>Stories about what happens when someone new takes over—someone with a vision of how things ought to be.  Including international economics correspondent Adam Davidson of thePlanet Money podcaston how Obama's new stimulus plan might actually be the first ever test of a very, very old theory.

Prologue
Dave Hill tells us about his job at a homeless shelter in New York. He liked the job—even the most menial parts. After about a year, he's asked to;become supervisor, which is exciting for him, because he's never been in charge of anything before. But on his very first shift, something goes terribly wrong, without Dave even knowing about it. (3 minutes) _Dave Hill_

Act One
Dave Hill continues his story. When he talked to a co-worker the morning after his first shift as a night supervisor, he learned that the place isn’t quite what he thought it was. For one thing, most of his colleagues are crack addicts. Dave is the star of a late-night talk show called the Dave Hill Explosion, which he performs at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York. (7 minutes) _Dave Hill_

Act Two
An accountant, Bruce Wisan, is hired by the state of Utah to clean up a very complicated mess in a complicated place: Short Creek, home to hundreds of members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints—or FLDS, which practices polygamy. The community had been run by the notorious Warren Jeffs, now in prison for rape. Jeffs had been in charge of the FLDS church, and also of the giant trust which church members paid into all their lives. But when Jeffs became a fugitive, he began to mismanage the $112 million trust, and so the Utah attorney general stepped in, giving Wisan control. Wisan had plans: He was going to modernize the town utilities, improve the roads, and most important, give people titles to their homes, which under Jeffs were owned and controlled by the church trust. But Wisan quickly ran into an enormous problem: The majority of people in Short Creek would have nothing to do with him or his ideas. Claire Hoffman reports. Claire also wrote about Wisan for Portfolio Magazine in June 2008, in an article called " Satan's Accountant ." (23 minutes) _Claire Hoffman_

Act Three
This American Life Senior Producer Julie Snyder talks to Ira about her rather alarming theory regarding the new president's smoking habits. (2 minutes) _Julie Snyder_

Act Four
Our crack economics duo, Producer Alex Blumberg and NPR International Economics Correspondent Adam Davidson, on how a dead, slutty, elitist British man, John Maynard Keynes, is about to take over the American economy. President Obama's new stimulus plan relies on Keynes'; theory, which says that government can spend its way out of a downward economic spiral. Alex and Adam explain why this might actually be the first ever test of this very old idea. You can hear Alex and Adam's other economics stories on the Planet Money podcast . (20 minutes) _Alex Blumberg, Adam Davidson, Planet Money_

      <description>Of all the 6 and a half billion people in the world, what are the odds that any two people are a real match? Stories from people who know they've beat the odds, and the lengths they've gone to do it. Including an American professor who sings Chinese opera for anyone who'll listen, to get one step closer to his mate, and Mike Birbiglia on meeting his girlfriend's... boyfriend.

Prologue
NPR reporter David Kestenbaum tells host Ira Glass about the time, when he was doing graduate work in physics, he and his other single friends decided to figure out the mathematical probability that they'd find girlfriends. They wanted to know what the chances were that there was more than one person in the world for them. And This American Life Producer Alex Blumberg and his wife, Nazanin Rafsanjani, reveal the subject of their first fight: They were in love, walking in the park, when Nazanin asked him if it felt like fate—like she was the only one for him. (Yes Alex, there is a wrong answer to that question.) When you're in love, it always feels like it was meant to be, whether or not it really, statistically speaking, is. (9 minutes) _Alex Blumberg, David Kestenbaum_

Act One
When Eric Hayot was 23, he went on an exchange program to China one summer. He took an opera class on a lark, and before he knew it, he was on stage, singing the part of a famous judge. Accompanying him, on a traditional two-stringed fiddle, was a 19-year-old musician named Yuanyuan Di. Eric fell for her the moment he saw her, and began spending time with her. But a couple of weeks later he went back to the States, and that was that. They didn't keep in touch—it was too hard to communicate by letter. Then, two years later, Eric went back to China to study, and decided he had to find Yuanyuan again. Only he didn't have her phone number, or address or any other way to contact her. So to track her down, he deployed his secret weapon: The fact that Chinese people love it when westerners sing Chinese songs. This American Life Producer Sarah Koenig reports. (19 minutes) _Sarah Koenig_

Act Two
A live performance detailing a humiliating love affair. When comedian Mike Birbiglia was in high school, he fell for a cool girl named Amanda. They start going out, and it's going great, except that Amanda hasn't quite broken up with Scott, her other boyfriend. So for instance when Mike goes to Amanda's house to meet her parents, Scott's there too, and Amanda takes turns making out with each of them while the other's in the bathroom. It only gets worse. (9 minutes) _Mike Birbiglia_

      <description>The collapse of the banking system explained, in just 59 minutes. Alex Blumberg and Adam Davidson are back to help all of us understand the news. For instance, when we talk about an insolvent bank, what does it actually mean, and why are we giving hundreds of billions of dollars to rich bankers who screwed up their own businesses? Also, two guys go to New Jersey to look at a toxic asset.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass plays clips from TV in a recent senate hearing and talks about how confusing the current banking crisis is.  But fortunately today, we have the team that brought us our show that explained the mortgage crisis a year ago, back to explain entire the banking system in 40 minutes. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Alex Blumberg and Adam Davidson tackle a very tough subject: Trying to explain exactly what a bank is and does. They talk to a number of experts about what has gone wrong in banking, but not before bringing us all up to speed on some banking basics, like understanding a bank balance sheet, and a bank's assets and liabilities, and the squishy business of what banks say about their balance sheets compared to what they are. Alex and Adam walk us step by step through the complications of the US government buying up bad assets from banks, and explain why, when it comes to footing the bill, the government might just prefer to not be in charge of the very banks it is having taxpayers bailout. From a dollhouse, to a hypothetical bank worth tens of dollars, to the trillions of dollars being spent to keep banks afloat, Alex and Adam talk economy, and where we might be headed. (39 minutes) _Alex Blumberg, Adam Davidson, Planet Money_

Act Two
Not everyone hates the idea of "toxic assets." Reporter Lisa Chow goes to New Jersey to follow two guys on their quest to clean up some of America's bad mortgages—by buying them, and going straight to the homes themselves to have a look at how dire the situation really is. (13 minutes) _Lisa Chow_

      <description>Bernie Epton went down in history as the Other Guy: the white opponent who almost defeated the first black mayor of Chicago. But what's the real story of someone who ended up on the wrong side of history? That and other stories of people with wildly popular or unpopular views for one moment in time, and how those views stand up years, decades, even centuries later.

Act One
For NPR's Adam Davidson, dropping out of college is the worst thing any young person can do in this economy. So when Adam's favorite cousin DJ does just that, Adam brings in a professor of economics from Georgetown University to help persuade DJ to get back on the right track. Only after hearing them both out, the professor thinks Adam, not DJ, might be the one on the wrong side of things. (10 minutes) _Adam Davidson_

Act Two
Rany Jazayerli was thrilled when one of his closest friends, Mazen, was hired by the Obama campaign as the liaison to the Muslim community, in the months before the presidential election. It only took 3 weeks for a newspaper to attack his character, and for Mazen to resign from the job of a lifetime. Rany reads about the incident, from a piece he wrote for FiveThirtyEight.com . (7 minutes) _Rany Jazayerli_

Act Three
Sketch comedy troupe Kasper Hauser performs a radio game show, where a race car driver, a guy fluent in middle English, and a teacher take turns cramming all the 21st century wisdom they can into a 30 second phone call to the 14th century. (4 minutes) _Kasper Hauser Troupe_

Act Four
When Bernie Epton ran for mayor of Chicago in 1983, he was a long shot—Chicago historically voted in democrat mayors, and Bernie himself didn't think he stood a chance. Beyond that, Bernie was a moderate republican, with some liberal tendencies: He was a opponent of McCarthyism, he marched in Memphis after Dr. King's assassination, and his kids went to majority black schools. Until Harold Washington was chosen as the democratic candidate to beat, and the run for mayor of Chicago quickly became about race, and Bernie became a real contender for mayor. In the weeks leading up to the election, Bernie became the symbol of white hope for voters who sought to place race before party. Reporter Alex Kotlowitz speaks to Bernie Epton's daughter Dale and son Jeff, to find out what happened during the election of 1983 and the years to follow, and the legacy that Bernie Epton even now can't escape. (25 minutes) _Alex Kotlowitz_

      <description>The economy works in mysterious ways. This week, we highlight the unusual circumstances our economic drought has left us in, and the newly hatched plans being made to survive it.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass notes the sub-industry in journalism right now of reporting anything that looks like a sign of the recession. He then goes on to list a handful of his own favorites, including a dentist who's seen an increase in broken teeth from grinding, and a decrease in shark attacks. (2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Ira goes to Chicago's Rogers Park neighborhood to talk to some condo owners who are in a precarious situation—since the housing market crash, the developer who renovated and sold them their units—Haso Meseljevic—has all but disappeared. He's in foreclosure on half of their building's units. His son Samel Meseljevic and lawyer Hugh Howard aren't much help either. In the meantime, they have no one to pay for the repairs and maintenance of the building they all bought into. In the story Ira speaks to Brian C. White, the Lakeside CDC executive director, which is a not-for-profit lobbying for affordable housing in the northernmost neighborhoods in Chicago. He also speaks with condo owner/mortgage banker Jon Miller, who has a website at chicagomortgagefinance.com . (21 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
NPR reporter and Planet Money contributor Chana Jaffe-Walt reports this story of what it really looks like when a bank fails and is taken over by the FDIC. She talks to the former employees and a handful of FDIC staff about the Friday night when the Bank of Clark County was interrupted and closed by 80 FDIC employees, who had every step of their secret operation down to a science. (20 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt, Planet Money_

Act Three
We hear 5 employees of different Circuit City store locations read their accounts of what it was like when the largest electronics chain in the US had less than 2 months to liquidate its entire inventory and close its doors. (12 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>Stories of people forced to let go of their firmly held beliefs. When the daughter of a pro-choice activist concludes that abortion is murder, her mother goes to extraordinary lengths to persuade her daughter to switch sides. And after a woman loses her faith, a football coach—whom she's never met—tries to restore it.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks to Jay Allison, who is in charge of the team at This I Believe , an essay series. Jay wonders why Ira's never contributed an essay about what he believes. (9 minutes) _Jay Allison, Ira Glass_

Act One
One day in January Alex French got a call from his mom, saying that she'd been laid off. A few hours later she called to say that so had his dad. Alex takes a trip to Massachusetts to see how his parents are getting by since entering unemployment for the first time, in his father's case, in 30 years. (9 minutes) _Alex French_

Act Two
This past Christmas a story swept the internet about a football coach at a Christian high school in Texas who inspired his team's fans to root for the opposition: A team from the local juvenile correctional facility. Among the thousands of emails that the coach received in response to his actions, one stood out to him. Trisha Sebastian mentioned her loss of faith, and coach Hogan got a message from God that he was meant to bring her back. We eavesdrop on their phone calls. (19 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
When Molly Antopol was in 7th grade she learned what abortion was—and it sounded to her like murder. Her mom, a pro-choice activist made it her mission to change her daughter's mind. And went to extraordinary lengths to do so. Molly tells the story. (8 minutes) _Molly Antopol_

Act Four
Joel and Kate were both working in a psychiatric hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts. They both like each other, and she tries to impress him by always wearing her favorite pair of jeans. Little did she know, the jeans were maybe the only thing about her that he didn't like. (8 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>A live episode of the radio program, including stories told on stage by Dan Savage and Mike Birbiglia.

Prologue
There's a town in Florida where if you shoplift, and get caught, a judge will send you back to the scene of your crime to stand in front of the store, with a large sign that reads "I stole from this store." Ira and producer Lisa Pollak talk to one such teenager who was caught stealing from a convenience store, the supervisor overseeing her punishment, and the judge who sends her there. (11 minutes) _Ira Glass, Lisa Pollak_

Act One
Mike Birbiglia recalls being in a car accident with a hit and run drunk driver.  In the weeks that follow, Mike's brush with death turns into a full blown nightmare when the police report is so poorly filled out that somehow Mike winds up owing the drunk driver 12 thousand dollars…not because it's fair, but because he can't get anyone to listen to him. (15 minutes) _Mike Birbiglia_

Act Two
Ira invites Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon to perform a song from his Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog DVD extra commentary, which is a musical satire that pokes fun at the idea of DVD commentary. Joss has directed many films, including The Avengers . (10 minutes) _Joss Whedon_

Act Three
Dan Savage points a finger at the Catholic Church for being the kind of criminal organization that drives him to atheism—despite the fact that he still wants to believe he'll see his mom in heaven someday. Dan writes the sex advice column Savage Love and is the author of several books including The Commitment . (16 minutes) _Dan Savage_

      <description>Stories of people who find themselves in situations far from the beaten path, where there are no guidelines and no useful precedents, including the return ofSquirrel Cop.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks a veteran police officer about a time in his 20s when he gets sent to a car accident—and it turns out the driver at fault was a nicely dressed chimpanzee. The chimp seemed harmless enough until the other police officer on duty tries to arrest the chimp&'s owner. (10 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Reporter Chris Arnold visits a foreclosure prevention event to find out the painful truth about the mortgage crisis: 90% of foreclosures are being enforced by servicing companies not because it helps the banks to foreclose, and not because home owners aren't interested in renegotiating their loan terms, but because there's just no system in place to handle the sheer volume of loans that need help. (20 minutes) _Chris Arnold, Planet Money_

Act Two
Reporter Ted Gesing interviews Mike Nyberg about adopting a little girl from Samoa, only to learn over time that her Samoan family had no intention of giving her up for adoption. The US adoption agency had told the Nybergs that their adoption would be closed, and that their little girl Elleia had been living in a foster home waiting for adoptive parents; but in Samoa, Elleia's parents were told that their daughter could come to the US and receive a better education, and that the adoptive family would send money and regular updates on their daughter's progress. The whole situation leaves the Nybergs trying to find their way through sticky moral territory. (31 minutes) _Ted Gesing_

      <description>A well-known activist—an anarchic, revolutionary activist—is accused of spying on other activists for the FBI. The strangest thing about the rumor is, it's true. How Brandon Darby transformed from cop-hater to federal witness. Plus, a story by Etgar Keret, about a boy who betrays his people with a pair of shoes.

Prologue
Ira talks with reporter My Thuan Tran of The Los Angeles Times about how San Jose City Councilwoman Madison Nguyen went from being the "golden child" of the Vietnamese community to someone who faced weekly protests and a hunger striker. Turns out red-baiting is alive and well in the Vietnamese-American community. We also hear from Nguyen and from reporter Thanh Tan of Idaho Public Television about a similar case that involved her dad, Duc Tan. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass, Thanh Tan, My Thuan Tran_

Act One
The story from the prologue continues. (6 minutes) _My Thuan Tran_

Act Two
Brandon Darby was a radical activist and one of the founders of the incredibly effective relief organization Common Ground.

      <description>Since Congress hasn't held 1930's-style hearings into the causes of the financial crisis, we stage one of our own. The subject? The regulators and watchdogs who were supposed to be overseeing the banks and the finance industry—to make sure things wouldn't blow up like they have. Clearly something went wrong. Today we pound a gavel and ask: Where were the watchmen?

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with Michael Perrino, a law professor at St Johns University School of Law in New York, who wrote a book about Ferdinand Pecora called The Hellhound of Wall Street . Pecora was the lead attorney in the Senate Banking Committee hearings in the 1930s looking into wrongdoing in the banking industry. When he got the job, he turned the hearings from an unimportant and not terrible useful exercise into a real investigation into Wall Street and the causes of the 1929 stock market collapse. It spurred Congress to pass landmark reforms regulating Wall Street. Ira and Perrino talk about whether these kinds of hearings could or should happen today. (9 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Planet Money reporter Chana Joffe-Walt asks a simple question: Who was the federal regulator who was supposed to be regulating AIG? The answer turns out to be far from simple. (21 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt, Planet Money_

Act Two
Alex Blumberg and NPR correspondent (and "Planet Money" reporter) Dave Kestenbaum examine what went wrong with the credit ratings agencies. When all these financial instruments that brought down our economy—the mortgage backed securities, the derivatives—were originally issued, the rating agencies (Standard and Poors, Moody's and Fitch) gave many of these things their top rating of triple-A. Because of the great ratings, trillions were invested. And then the ratings turned out to be wrong. What happened? (25 minutes) _Alex Blumberg, David Kestenbaum, Planet Money_

      <description>This week we bring you little-known and surprising stories of how all sorts of institutions—from a controversial legal precedent to a Hollywood teen dance flick—began. In one story, a man tries to set the record straight about his life's achievements, which he says include inventing thumb wrestling and popularizing the eating of shrimp in the New York area. And the story of a seven-year-old old boy trying to figure out where he comes from.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks to business professor Pino Audia and Fast Company magazine columnist Dan Heath about corporate creation myths, and why so many of them involve garages. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Producer Sarah Koenig tells the story of her father, Julian Koenig, the legendary advertising copywriter whose work includes the slogan "Timex takes a licking and keeps on ticking" and Volkswagen's "Think Small" ads. For years Sarah has heard her dad accuse a former partner of stealing some of his best ideas, but until recently she never paid much attention. Then she started asking her dad for details of this fight for his legacy, and what she learned surprised her. (20 minutes) _Sarah Koenig_

Act Two
Ira tells the story of the 1953 U.S. Supreme Court case that formed the basis for the controversial state secret privilege—the precedent that allows the United States government to stop lawsuits by claiming that national security secrets might be revealed in court. Ira talks to Barry Siegel, author of the book Claim of Privilege , and Judy Loether, whose father's death was at the center of the landmark Supreme Court case. (14 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
Peter Sagal, host of NPR's Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me , tells Ira the origin story of one of the worst movie sequels ever made. (5 minutes) _Peter Sagal_

Act Four
Reporter Mary Wiltenburg tells the story of a little boy stymied by the question "Where do you come from?" (8 minutes) _Mary Wiltenburg_

      <description>Sometimes when things go wrong, parsing out who all is to blame and taking them to task is justtoo complicated and haaaard! What's easy is pinning it all on one person and watching them go down in flames.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks to Rich Farrell, writer and former addict, about the code of silence he learned as a kid, and the times he took the fall for his friends' misdeeds. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Mike Birbiglia explains the chain of events that resulted in him becoming the fall guy for his entire high school, and how it took him a while to catch on to what was happening. This story was recorded live in front of an audience in Cambridge, Mass. (10 minutes) _Mike Birbiglia_

Act Two
The story of a famous but not well-understood political fall guy, someone who became a scapegoat for American policies worldwide. Philip Gourevitch writes about listening to nine hours of interviews with Lynndie England, the American servicewoman photographed at Abu Ghraib prison holding a leash with a naked, Iraqi prisoner on the end of it. Philip Gourevitch's book about what happened in that prison and in those photos is called The Ballad of Abu Ghraib . Audio in this act came from Errol Morris's interviews in the film Standard Operating Procedure . (15 minutes) _Philip Gourevitch_

Act Three
Planet Money 's Alex Blumberg and Adam Davidson talk to Ira about the lawsuit phase of the economic crisis, and the ongoing search to find someone to take the blame. So far at least 196 lawsuits are simply banks suing other banks. (10 minutes) _Alex Blumberg, Adam Davidson, Planet Money_

Act Four
In big families, there's often one kid who always gets blamed when something goes wrong. But Shalom Auslander came from a small family, so the role of fall guy was up for grabs. Shalom Auslander is the author of several books, including Foreskin's Lament . (13 minutes) _Shalom Auslander_

      <description>It's tempting to act as your own lawyer, to argue your own cause. Who better to defend your position than you? This week, stories of pro se defenses: Some brilliant, some disastrous. A man fakes his way into an insane asylum by pretending to be crazy, and then can't argue his way back out. And another man uses vigilante justice to defend his sister's honor, using a strategy he didn't know he had in him.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass describes the scene at a courthouse resource center in lower Manhattan where people learn how to represent themselves in civil court. Attorney Ruth Sharfman, who assists at the center, tells Ira that some of the pro se litigants are more prepared for the job than others. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
From London, TAL contributor Jon Ronson tells the story of a man who has spent more than a decade trying to convince doctors that he's not mentally ill. But the more he argues his case, the less they believe him. (25 minutes) _Jon Ronson_

Act Two
Earlier this year, admitted drug user Jorge Cruz decided to act as his own lawyer in an Albany, New York criminal court. Impossibly, he won. Ira talks to Francisco Calderon, the assistant district attorney who prosecuted the case, about what it feels like to lose to an amateur. (10 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
Jeff Simmermon tells a story from his days as a student teacher, about a time when he decided to forgo all the rules, and administer frontier justice on the fly. This story was recorded in front of an audience at the Moth storytelling series. Jeff tells other stories on his blog AndIAmNotLying.com (9 minutes) _Jeff Simmermon_

Act Four
Stef Willen tells Ira about a time that she took matters into her own hands, even though she was only a lowly production assistant on a reality show. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>Stories where the fine print changes everything, whether you read it or not.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks about the infamous line in the band Van Halen's contract insisting that the groups' dressing room include a bowl of M&Ms with all the brown M&Ms removed. Ira used to think this request was just petulant rock-star behavior. Then he talked to John Flansburgh, from the band They Might Be Giants —who are beginning their 40-city tour this October—and he explained why the M&M clause was actually an ingenious business strategy. (6 minutes) _They Might Be Giants_

Act One
In Tehran in 2004, Omid Memarian confessed to doing things he'd never done, meeting people he'd never met, following plots he'd never heard of.

      <description>The U.S. government spent two years on a sting operation trapping an Indian man named Hemant Lakhani, whom they suspected of being an illegal arms dealer. It's one of the first cases that went to trial in the War on Terror, and one the Justice Department pointed to as one of their big successes. In the end, they got Lakhani, red-handed, delivering a missile to a terrorist in New Jersey. The only problem was, nothing in the sting was what it appeared to be. Including the missile.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass describes a recent terrorism case in Newburgh, N.Y., in which four men were arrested after planting bombs in front of a synagogue and Jewish community center. Ira discusses the case with Aziz Huq, assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School and co-author of Unchecked and Unbalanced: Presidential Power in a Time of Terror . Huq says the Newburgh case isn't what it seems, because without the help of a government informant, the four men probably wouldn't have been able to organize an act of terrorism. The Newburgh case is part of a pattern of sting operations the government has undertaken since September 11th as part of its mandate to catch terrorists before they strike. The first big investigation to test this approach—the case of Hemant Lakhani—is the subject of today's show.. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Hemant Lakhani, an Indian-born British citizen, had been a salesman all his life. Clothing, rice, oil...it didn't matter to him what, as long as he could spin a deal. Then one day, sitting in a hotel room with a gangster he happened to know, the phone rang. It wasa business friend of the gangster's, calling from America. The man on the phone was rich, Lakhani was told. Maybe he would invest in Lakhani's latest venture. So Lakhani started talking to the man over the phone. Pretty soon they set up a meeting at a hotel in New Jersey, to talk business. But when Lakhani got there, the man seemed to be only interested in buying weapons. Illegal weapons, for Somali terrorists. Lakhani, always eager to make a deal, said he can help him out. What he didn't know, is that the supposed rich business man was an FBI informant, and that he had just walked into an elaborate government sting. Petra Bartosiewicz reports. (30 minutes) _Petra Bartosiewicz_

Act Two
Our story about Hemant Lakhani's case continues, through the sting and the trial. (21 minutes.) _Petra Bartosiewicz_

Act Three
Ira talks to Aziz Huq about whether cases like Lahkani's will continue to be pursued under the Obama administration, and why that's problematic. (2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

These include Robert Woodhill, the general manager, who needs a good sales day so he can beat his friend Andy, who manages a rest stop in Maine, in their weekly competition. Ira hangs out with a group of foreign students who’ve landed in Plattekill on a summer work program, and reporter Lisa Pollak gets travel tips from Lenny Wheat, who works at the rest stop’s information booth.

Reporters Nancy Updike and Jay Allison hang out for the graveyard shift – midnight to 8 a.m. – and find a surprising amount of romance at the rest stop.

      <description>This week we bring you stories about friends. Or wait, enemies? How about both? Tales of estranged sisters, BFFs breaking up and making up and breaking up, and how reality stars walk the fine line between making friends and making a name for themselves. Including a story from David Rakoff, whose new bookHalf Emptyis available now.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass plays tape of two women who ended up as frenemies.They kept trying to be friends, but couldn't help themselves from fighting. Ira then speaks with psychologist Julianne Holt-Lunstad who has run scientific studies to answer the question: Why don't we simply end these troubling kinds of friendships? Holt-Lunstad's research also shows that these relationships are much more common than you might think. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Family members can easily be frenemies. You're stuck with them. You love them. They sometimes do things that make you feel very strange. Which is how Jeanne Darst felt when her sister married a Muslim man and pulled away from her family. Darst is finishing her first book, Fiction Ruined My Family . (16 minutes) _Jeanne Darst_

Act Two
We head to deep inside the natural habitat of frenemies: Reality TV. Rich Juzwiak is a full-time blogger for VH1 and his own pop-culture blog which means he's spent a lot of time watching and dissecting reality TV shows. And last year, he noticed that one sentence seems to repeat an awful lot in the frenemy friendships that happen on reality TV. (5 minutes) _Rich Juzwiak_

Act Three
Ira talks with lexicographer Erin McKean about the origin of the word frenemy. (6 minutes)

Act Four
David Rakoff demonstrates—in rhyme—how to make a wedding toast for people you never wanted to see married in the first place. Rakoff is the author of several books, most recently Half Empty . (15 minutes) _David Rakoff_

Act Five
Ira talks to a woman about a childhood friend of hers who mysteriously shows up after decades, for reasons that are only revealed as their correspondence unfolds. (15 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with NPR correspondent Adam Davidson about a black tie event he attended in the spring of 2008.

Adam checks back with one of the men he met at that dinner and learns how his views have changed, pretty radically, over the last 18 months. (5 minutes) _Adam Davidson, Planet Money_

Act One
We replay sections from the original "Giant Pool of Money," in which This American Life producer Alex Blumberg teams up with NPR's Adam Davidson to tell the story of how the U.S. got itself into a housing crisis. They talk to people who were actually working in the housing, banking, finance and mortgage industries, about what they thought during the boom times, and why the bust happened. We hear from a mortgage company sales manager who was making over a million dollars a year and spending his time clubbing with celebrities. We meet a man who got into the mortgage industry after getting hired away from his previous job as a bartender. And we follow a Marine who was tricked into an unaffordable mortgage as he tries to save his house from foreclosure. (30 minutes) _Alex Blumberg, Adam Davidson, Planet Money_

Act Two
We catch back up with the people we met in 2008, to see how they've fared over the last 18 months. We talk to Clarence Nathan, who in 2008 received a half million dollar loan that he said he wouldn't have given himself; Jim Finkel, a Wall Street finance guy, who put together and managed complicated mortgage-based financial securities; Richard Campbell, the Marine who was facing foreclosure; and Glen Pizzolorusso, the mortgage company sales manager who led the life of a b-list celebrity. (19 minutes) _Alex Blumberg, Adam Davidson_

      <description>In 2009, The Princeton Review named Penn State the #1 Party School in America. It's a rotating crown—last year it was University of Florida, before that it was West Virginia University. So we wondered: what's it like to be at the country's top party school?

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks to Leo Paur, coach of a high school football team in Utah that hasn't won a game in two and ahalf seasons, about how he motivates his team to keep going after so many crushing defeats. Namely: You decide that you're about to turn things around. You decide that you are the miracle long shot team that will come from behind and beats the odds.

      <description>A man named David Maclean finds himself in a train station in India, with no idea how he got there or who he is. His memory gone, he has no choice but to let other people—police, doctors, friends, family—create an identity for him. David's book about this incident is calledThe Answer to the Riddle Is Me. Plus other stories of filling in the blank.

Prologue
On every British nuclear submarine, there is a safe. Inside that safe is another safe.

This story includes excerpts from a radio documentary called "The Human Button" ( click to listen or right-click to save the file), which originally aired on BBC Radio 4 in December, 2008.

Act One
If you don't pay the rent on a self storage unit, eventually all of your stuff can go up for auction. But the people bidding aren't allowed to dig around.

Jon Mooallem visited auctions in Northern California, and learned the surprising techniques people use to tell junk from treasure. Jon is a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine , and is author of the book Wild Ones . (16 minutes) _Jon Mooallem_

Act Two
Fred van Doorninck and George Bass were unlikely candidates for pioneering underwater Byzantine archaeology—Fred hates water, and George found the Byzantine era boring.

Planet Money's Adam Davidson tells the story. (12 minutes) _Adam Davidson_

Act Three
On October 13, 2002, David MacLean woke up in India with no memory of who he was or how he got there.

Prologue

be closed, sending thousands of car workers looking for jobs. In this hour-long story, NPR Automotive Correspondent Frank Langfitt tells the story of NUMMI and why GM—and the rest of the American car business—wasn't able to learn from it more quickly. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Prologue
Behind enemy lines, sometimes people get confused about whose side they're on...and how to fight the enemy. (2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Patrick Wall was a special kind of monk. He was a fixer. The Catholic church sent him to problem parishes where priests had been removed because of scandal.

(21 minutes) _Carl Marziali_

Act Two
You can divide all living creatures into two camps. We humans are in one camp, along with lots of other things like dogs and birds and trees and caterpillars. In the other camp are the things that live inside of us, the bacterias and viruses, the worms and protozoans, in short, parasites. Scientists estimate that the parasites outnumber us and our free-living allies by 3 to 1. Carl Zimmer talks with Ira about how parasites manage the trick of living inside of us, behind enemy lines, without us finding out. Carl is the author of the book " Parasite Rex ." (10 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
Another story about parasites. When Jasper Lawrence learned that hookworms might lessen the effects of his allergies, he set out on a unique mission: To travel to West Africa and purposefully become infected with the parasite.

      <description>We bring you stories of bridges from three different countries, including one in China that's famous for its massive size and its high suicide rate. One takes it upon himself to patrol the bridge, looking for jumpers. You can read entries from the watchman's bloghere. This and other stories where we stop before getting to the other side.

Prologue
Ira speaks with Richard Dorsay, who became famous in 2004 when police learned that for years Richard and a friend had been living inside of a Chicago bridge. And this was no ordinary bridge. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
There is a four mile long bridge in Naan-jing China, famous for how many people jump off to commit suicide. In 2003, a man named Chen Sah began spending all of his weekends on the bridge, trying to single handedly stop the jumpers. Reporter Mike Paterniti tells his story of meeting Mr. Chen. A story Paterniti wrote about Mr. Chen appears in GQ Magazine . (15 minutes) _Mike Paterniti_

Act Two
In the Middle East, hundreds and hundreds of tunnels connect the Gaza strip and Egypt, allowing supplies to bypass the Israeli blockade against Hamas-controlled Gaza. Producer Nancy Updike speaks with Ira about the tunnels, and plays tape from an interview she conducted with a tunnel owner. (15 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Three
Isaiah Thompson tells the story of the Julia Tuttle Causeway in Miami, a bridge that became home to a population of sex offenders, after a powerful lobbyist named Ron Book helped make it illegal for them live almost anywhere else in the city. Isaiah Thompson is a reporter and columnist for the Philadelphia City Paper . (20 minutes) _Isaiah Thompson_

      <description>Unprecedented amounts of money have been pledged to Haitian relief in the last few months. American households have given over $1 billion and in March, 120 countries pledged over $9 billion(!) to rebuild. The only problem is that—historically—blanketing a country in aid and money has never really worked so well. Is there a chance this time things could be different?

Prologue
Four months after the earthquake in Haiti, Ira Glass talks to Haitian reporter Joseph-Romuald Felix while Romuald tours a tent camp in the Petionville suburb of Port au Prince. Romuald talks to four children—two of them have eaten this day, two have not. Nan Buzard, who heads the American Red Cross effort in Haiti, tells Ira that relief agencies have to walk a thin line between helping too little and helping too much. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Adam Davidson and Chana Joffe-Walt from Planet Money follow one Haitian farmer, with the modest crop of two mango trees, through a byzantine system of aid agencies, NGOs, and government bureaucracy as the farmer tries the impossible—to get some plastic milk crates to store and transport her mangoes. Planet Money is a co-production with NPR News. Check out their blog and podcast . (25 minutes) _Adam Davidson, Chana Joffe-Walt, Planet Money_

Act Two
Apricot Irving grew up on a missionary compound in Limbe, in the north of Haiti, and visits the missionary hospital there. It's pretty well stocked and staffed but, oddly, kind of a ghost town. Meanwhile, a rural Haitian-run clinic 5 miles away, without anywhere near the resources of the missionary hospital, is packed with people. Apricot spends time with the American doctor who used to head the missionary hospital but left in order to help foster a "new" Haiti at the Haitian-run clinic. Apricot Irving is writing a memoir about her experiences growing up on the missionary compound. She's currently looking for a publisher. (13 minutes) _Apricot Irving_

Act Three
Short story writer Ben Fountain tours Port au Prince with his best friend—one of the few eye doctors in the country—and glimpses a cautionary future for us all. Ben Fountain is the author of the short story collection Brief Encounters with Che Guevera . (13 minutes)

      <description>Stories of people held captive — by criminals, by paperwork, and in one man's case, his own body — and the ways they try to cope.

Prologue
Ira Glass speaks with a man named Daniel Johnson, who is in the K&R business. That's the kidnap and ransom business, where a company helps you negotiate to get back your loved one. Daniel explains some surprising strategies for surviving as a hostage. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
So much kidnapping happens in Colombia that the biggest radio station in the country has a show aimed specifically at an audience of kidnapping victims. Reporter Annie Correal tells the story. Annie originally produced this as a longer story with Jay Allison for the website transom.org . Annie is a reporter for the Newspaper El Diario . (15 minutes) _Jay Allison, Annie Correal_

Act Two
An angry man in New Orleans seeks revenge against people who bought property that he formerly owned and that was seized by the city. The homeowners find themselves trapped in a morass of paperwork, court visits...and worse. Wayne Curtis tells the story. Wayne is a contributing editor of the Atlantic Magazine . (23 minutes) _Wayne Curtis_

Act Three
Four years ago, Matt Frerking started having attacks where he simply couldn't move his body. That's strange in itself, but what's even stranger is the apparent cause of the attacks. Chris Higgins tells the story. This story was turned into a comedy, Ode to Joy , directed by Jason Winer and starring Martin Freeman and Morena Baccarin. (11 minutes) _Chris Higgins_

Prologue
We hear recordings from all over the country—and the world—of politicians arguing over budgets. (2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Why is it that Barbados and Jamaica faced almost identical financial crises, but now Jamaica is incredibly poor and Barbados is prospering?

      <description>Stories of first encounters with unknown and distant beings: Girls, foreigners and perhaps even aliens. Including a story by comedian Mike Birbiglia about his first kiss.

Prologue
Ira speaks with Scott Krepel—via his interpreter Marc Holmes—about what happened when Scott got cochlear implants as a kid and could suddenly hear for the first time. (Download the transcript of this story here .) (9 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Ira Glass mentions a very silly mistake he made with a girl when he was in junior high. Then comedian Mike Birbiglia tells the story of his rocky foray into the world of making out with girls. Mike has a book coming out this Fall called Sleepwalk With Me and Other Painfully True Stories , which features this story and some others he’s told here on This American Life . (15 minutes) _Mike Birbiglia, Ira Glass_

Act Two
Sara Blaisdell tells the story of a group of Iraqi brothers whom her husband Sam befriended over the internet, and has been speaking with weekly for almost seven years. Their surprisingly intimate relationship has pulled Sam into a world that few Americans can access. (23 minutes) _Sara Blaisdell_

Act Three
Ira Glass speaks with Paul Davies, chair of the Post-Detection Task Force of SETI . That stands for the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence, and Paul’s task is to figure out what to say to space aliens if we find them. Paul suggests starting simple, with binary code. But other people have some very different ideas, solicited by the social networking site Bebo . We heard about Paul Davies from an article that Jon Ronson wrote in the Guardian . In 2008, 501 images were beamed from a radio telescope in Eupatoria, Ukraine, towards Gliese 581 c, a planet 118 trillion miles away. People around the world submitted ideas to a social networking site called Bebo , and then users voted on the ones they thought should actually be sent, with the thought that extraterrestrials might one day receive them. The radio signal will take about 20 years to reach its destination. Here are a few of the images, courtesy of RDF Contact : (7 minutes) _Jon Ronson_

      <description>Crybabies are annoying. They whine, they complain, sometimes they ruin it for the rest of us. But being a crybaby can be a
really effective tactic. We have stories of crybabies in sports, in politics, on Wall Street, on the streets of California, including a new story by David Sedaris.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass with Dave Weigel, political reporter for Slate.com , about manufactured outrage in American politics, and how it's an effective way to bring in cash and mobilize your followers, as Christine O'Donnell and former Florida GOP Chairman Jim Greer have demonstrated. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Ira with Planet Money economics correspondent Adam Davidson on why—even after everything President Obama has done to save Wall Street, actions which have led to record profits and bonuses—Wall Street seems ungrateful.

Planet Money is a co-production of This American Life and NPR News. (16 minutes) _Adam Davidson, Jane Feltes, Planet Money_

Act Three
In California, a kind of crybaby cottage industry has popped up around, of all things, the Americans with Disabilities Act—the federal law that requires all public places to meet a minimum level of accessibility.

      <description>Operation Iraqi Freedom is over. And the next chapter of Iraq is being written now. But what actually happened there the last seven years? Producer Nancy Updike and reporter Larry Kaplow spent a month in Iraq talking to Iraqis and Americans about the war that tore the country apart, and what's happening as we try to put it back together.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass speaks with reporter Larry Kaplow and producer Nancy Updike, who spent a month in Iraq as the US combat mission was ending, in August 2010, talking to Iraqis.

(8 minutes) _Ira Glass, Larry Kaplow, Nancy Updike_

Act One
To understand where we are today in Iraq, we tell the story of one Iraqi, Saad Oraibi Ghaffouri Al-Obeidi, also known as Abu Abed—a man who fought alongside the US during the surge, and is now in exile—and what he saw, and was part of, over seven years of the war. (28 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Two
Larry and Nancy head to Diyala Province north of Baghdad, and meet with a mayor and a member of the provincial council—like a state legislature—to see why is politics in Iraq utterly stalled. (9 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Three
The worst violence ended two years ago. Iraq is stable. Larry and Nancy go to an amusement park in Baghdad, a wedding hall, an herbal medicine shop, and other places to see what stability means—and doesn't mean—for Iraqis' everyday lives. Larry Kaplow reported from Iraq for six and a half years. Here are a few articles he wrote while he was Iraq bureau chief for Newsweek : The Last Day of the Iraq War Iraq Steps Out of Iran’s Shadow (9 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

      <description>A show for this year's midterm elections. Two best friends in Michigan, both political novices, get tired of yelling at their TVs and take matters into their own hands. They form a Tea Party chapter to effect political change. But when push comes to shove and they have to choose a candidate, their ideologies, their principles and their friendship explode.

Prologue
Republican Bill Jerke, a very conservative former Colorado State Legislator known as a tax "enemy," has a surprising job this election season.  He's going around to lots of different conservative groups and urging voters NOT to vote for three Colorado ballot initiatives that would cut state taxes so severely, they'd essentially strangle state government from here on out. Jerke says he appreciates the sentiment behind the ballot initiatives but says they simply go too far.  It's a weird election year—it's not just the political parties fighting each other but it's also the parties fighting amongst themselves, trying to figure out what they stand for, what they want for the future and what's the best path to get there. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Rich Carlson and Tom Swenor, two best friends in Michigan, got so fed up with the political process in the country, they decided to form their own Tea Party chapter in Petoskey, Michigan.  But as election season revved up and push came to shove, Rich and Tom had very different ideas about how to advance a conservative agenda.  In the end, their idealism, their jobs and their friendship have suffered the consequences. This American Life producer Ben Calhoun tells the story. (34 minutes) _Ben Calhoun_

Act Two
Jack Hitt has spent the last two years watching the Obama administration lose the news cycle and war of soundbites to Republicans day after day. Watching the Democrats run away from issues like health care reform and middle class tax cuts, Hitt wonders if there is some secret long-term master plan the Democrats are deploying, or if they're just incompetent. He goes to a Democratic Party insider—Paul Begala—to try to understand what the thinking behind the last two years of Democratic messaging has been. (16 minutes) _Jack Hitt_

      <description>In January 2010, reporters fromPlanet Moneybought a toxic asset—you know, the things that blew up wall street banks, sank the economy and brought the global financial system to a halt—one of those. And "Toxie" turned out to be an encyclopedia of the financial crisis.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass explains how the Planet Money team spent a thousand dollars of their own money to buy a toxic asset, and introduces Planet Money reporters David Kestenbaum and Chana Joffe-Walt. Their stories about "Toxie" have appeared on the Planet Money podcast and daily public radio news shows, and are collected here for the first time, into one epic, Dickensian tale. (3 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass, Planet Money_

Act One
David and Chana buy a toxic asset, from a guy named Wit Solberg, who used to work on Wall Street and now helps small banks who've been saddled with toxic assets. Turns out...it's hard to buy a toxic asset. But, they eventually find one that looks good, and looks like it will actually make them and the team money. (9 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt, David Kestenbaum, Planet Money_

Act Two
David and Chana try to track down the actual homeowners in their toxic asset. The toxic asset is made up of 2000 mortgages all over the country. Of those, half—1000 homeowners—are NOT making their payments. They eventually track one down. A retiree named Richard Koenig, who doesn't fit any of their preconceived notions of what a person facing foreclosure would look like. (13 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt, David Kestenbaum, Planet Money_

Act Three
David and Chana discover a dark criminal plot inside their toxic asset. They do this with the help of several reporters from the Sarasota Herald-Tribune , who turn them on to a Florida mortgage fraud mastermind nicknamed "The King of the Flip." (11 1/2 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt, David Kestenbaum, Planet Money_

Act Four
David and Chana meet another toxic asset owner, like themselves. Only difference, David and Chana bought theirs after it was already toxic, for a steep discount, 99% off. George Laufenberg bought his for full price. Now, it's almost worthless, and George is trying to figure out who to sue. (10 1/2 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt, David Kestenbaum, Planet Money_

Act Five
David and Chana's toxic asset, which has acquired the nickname Toxie, gets sick. And the payments that it's supposed to provide them every month stop. They try and figure out why. (10 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt, David Kestenbaum, Planet Money_

      <description>Five reporters stumbled on what seems like a basic question: What is money? The unsettling answer they found: Money is fiction. Photo: Stone money on the island of Yap.

Prologue
Ira Glass speaks with several members of the Planet Money team, who all found themselves—in the course of their reporting—independently asking the same stoner-ish question: What is money? Ira and Planet Money producer Jacob Goldstein discuss a pre-industrial society on the island of Yap that used giant stones as currency. The book that Jacob read about Yap is called The Island of Stone Money . (10 minutes) _Ira Glass, Planet Money_

Act One
A trip to a country where the fiction that is money completely fell apart. And in this same country, through a truly incredible piece of policy making, the government tricked a 150,000,000 people into believing their money had value again. Chana Joffe-Walt reports. (16 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt_

Act Two
Though the name of the Federal Reserve includes the word "federal," it's not actually part of the government. It's an independent institution tasked with something very simple, but very huge: Creating money out of thin air. And during this last financial crisis, the leaders of the Fed did things that they would never have considered doing in the past. Alex Blumberg and David Kestenbaum report on what the Fed usually does, and how, since 2008, it's taken a trip to what amounts to Fed Crazytown. (26 minutes) _Alex Blumberg, David Kestenbaum_

      <description>What if, say, the U.S.-led invasion of Grenada in 1983 had been decided, not by Ronald Reagan, but by a bunch of middle-schoolers? And what if every rule at your high school had been determined, not by teachers and administrators, but entirely by teenagers? This week, stories about whether, when it comes to governing, kids do any better than grown-ups.

Prologue
Ira Glass plays clips from a documentary film called Please Vote for Me , by Weijun Chen. It follows a third grade class in central China in the very first election they've ever had or witnessed. It's surprising how quickly these kids devise tactics used by adult politicians. The film originally aired on Independent Lens on PBS. (3 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Reporter Starlee Kine observes what would have happened if the U.S.-led invasion of Grenada in 1983 had been decided not by Ronald Reagan, but by a bunch of middle schoolers...and she remembers a class trip to the Nixon library, where Nixon aide HR Haldeman spoke. (20 minutes) _Starlee Kine_

Act Two
As adults battle over how climate change should be taught in school, we try an experiment. We ask Dr Roberta Johnson , the Executive Director of the National Earth Science Teachers Association, who helps develop curricula on climate change, to present the best evidence there is to a high school skeptic, a freshman named Erin Gustafson. Our question: Will Erin find any of it convincing? (14 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
Jyllian Gunther visits The Brooklyn Free School , where there are no courses, no tests and no homework, and where the kids decide everything about how the school is run, including discipline. Jyllian is a filmmaker , working on a documentary called The New Public . (16 minutes) _Jyllian Gunther_

      <description>This week we have stories where people's reactions move very slowly, including the story of a wedding 17 years in the making, and what it's like when you have a terminal illness that's supposed to kill you in a year or two, and it decides to take its time.Note:The story in Act One isn’t suitable for children, and we’d like to note a trigger warning to survivors of abuse.

Prologue
Ira Glass explains that, like the rest of America, we at This American Life are not tired of those stories of women who have no idea they're pregnant and then—poof—one day a baby pops out. Ira and several of our producers speak with Jennifer Lyne, who found out just a few days before giving birth and even appeared on the TV show I Didn't Know I Was Pregnant . Ira also speaks with a psychiatrist named Dr. Nehama Dresner about patients who go a long time in denial about physical conditions. (8 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Back in 2004, a reporter named David Holthouse published a remarkable story in the weekly paper he worked for, Westword . It's about something he waited his entire life to do...since childhood. David now lives and works in Alaska. Warning: this story is not suitable for children. (23 minutes) _David Holthouse_

Act Two
In Sean Lewis’ family, there is a legendarily romantic love story. It’s famous in his family partly because the story unfolded over decades and across continents, but also because no one can quite believe that out of everyone in their family, the one with the epic, swoon-inducing love story…is Mark. Sean is a performer and playwright now touring with two shows, which you can learn about at his website . (14 minutes) _Sean Lewis_

Act Three
"Slow to react" is usually an insult. But in this case the things that are slow...are cancer cells. Which is kind of how you want it. Producer Jonathan Menjivar tells this story about Katherine Russell Rich , who has lived with stage IV breast cancer for 18 years. Katherine is a writer whose most recent book is called Dreaming in Hindi . The discussion board that Katherine mentions in the story is online at breastcancer.org . (11 1/2 minutes) _Jonathan Menjivar_

Plus other people speaking their minds in very tough rooms.

Prologue
Thanksgiving 2002, the Ohm family's dinner conversation turned to the recent terrorist attacks.

Act Two
Writer Rosie Schaap tells the story of how she ingratiated herself into the adult society of the Metroliner commuter train bar car as a teenager. She would cast Tarot card prophesies for riders, in exchange for beer. This was fun and made her feel grown-up, until the cards showed her something she wasn't really ready to see. This story will be included in Rosie's upcoming collection of stories, entitled Drinking With Men . (12 minutes) _Rosie Schaap_

Act Three
Producer Jane Feltes spends a day with two young Mormons, on mission to possibly the least receptive environment they could find...the Upper West Side of Manhattan. (9 minutes) _Jane Feltes_

      <description>The formula for Coca-Cola is one of the most jealously guarded trade secrets in the world. Locked in a vault in Atlanta. Supposedly unreplicable. But we think we may have found the original recipe. And to see if the formula actually might be Coke, we made a batch. Or, anyway, we asked the folks atJones SodaandSovereign Flavorsto whip up some up, to see if it tastes like Coke.

Act One
The formula for Coca-Cola is one of the most jealously guarded trade secrets in the world. So we were surprised to come across a 1979 newspaper article with what looked like the original recipe for Coke. Talking to historian Mark Pendergrast, author of For God, Country and Coca-Cola , we were even more surprised when we found reasons to believe the recipe is real. (25 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Jake Halpern tells this story about document expert John Reznikoff, who came into possession of some materials which—if authentic—would change history. Then things got complicated. Jake is the author of several books, including World's End . (32 minutes)

      <description>Stories about the perils of giving and receiving gifts: Ones that go over spectacularly well in spite of being in poor taste, and ones that flop even with the best intentions. Including what happens when—surprise!—your whole past gets laid out for a live TV audience.

Prologue
Ira Glass hands off the show to guest host Nancy Updike, via a quick cell phone call, as he heads out of town to report a story. Nancy isn't quite sure how how she feels about being given this new role... ambivalence not uncommon for the receivers of gifts. (5 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act One
Allison Silverman reports on This Is Your Life , a show from the 1950s where unsuspecting—and often famous—audience members would have their biographies created on the spot for 40 million viewers. But is that really a present you'd want to receive? Allison is an Emmy Award-winning writer who has worked on The Daily Show , The Colbert Report , and Late Night with Conan O'Brien . (20 minutes) _Allison Silverman_

Act Two
Nancy Updike follows up on a Haaretz newspaper story about a sting operation against a medical marijuana supplier in Israel—a case where being giving was not the best idea. (9 1/2 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Three
Nancy speaks with Nazanin Rafsanjani about the Iranian custom Tarof, which leads people to constantly offer things they may not want to give, and to refuse things they really want. Nazanin is a producer for the public radio show On The Media . (7 1/2 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Four
Actor Michael Chernus reads Etgar Keret's short story "What Of This Goldfish Would You Wish?" in which a young man decides to make a documentary about the secret longings of everyday Israelis. But he's not prepared for what he sees in the house of a man named Sergei. Etgar's most recent book in English is The Girl on The Fridge . (13 minutes) _Michael Chernus, Etgar Keret_

      <description>Stories of people who've grown so accustomed to wartime that the lives they've left behind no longer make sense. Including a US battalion going home on leave after 15 months of deployment, and an Iraqi translator's story of life after the gig is up.

Prologue
Show host Nancy Updike also hosts a radio movie night. Her pick? The 1946 classic The Best Years of Our Lives , because even though it¹s over 60 years old, it says something about war that's hard to deny, even today. _Nancy Updike_

Act One
Ever wondered what you might do with 18 days of rest after serving 15 months in combat? Reporter David Finkel followed one group of soldiers in Iraq for 15 months, and reported all of it in his book The Good Soldiers . Here is our radio version of one of the chapters in his book, where we hear actors read aloud what soldiers and families of soldiers told David about their break. (21:42 min) _Michael Chernus, David Finkel_

Act Two
Last summer when Nancy Updike was reporting in Iraq, Sarah, an Iraqi woman in her 40s, was her interpreter. But it wasn't the first time Sarah had had that gig. Back in the height of the Iraq war, Sarah had found the career of a lifetime, or so she thought—translating for the US military. (26:22 min) Sarah is still trying to get a visa to the US. The lawyers working on her case first read about her in this story that ran in the Los Angeles Times , written by Bureau Chief Ned Parker. _Nancy Updike_

      <description>A drug court program that we believe is run differently from every other drug court in the country, doing some things that are contrary to the very philosophy of drug court. The result? People with offenses that would get minimal or no sentences elsewhere sometimes end up in the system five to ten years.

Act One
Ira reports from Glynn County Georgia on Superior Court Judge Amanda
Williams and how she runs the drug courts in Glynn, Camden and Wayne
counties.  We hear the story of Lindsey Dills, who forges two checks on her
parents' checking account when she's 17, one for $40 and one for $60, and
ends up in drug court for five and a half years, including 14 months behind
bars, and then she serves another five years after that—six months of it
in Arrendale State Prison, the other four and a half on probation.  The
average drug court program in the U.S. lasts 15 months.  But one main way
that Judge Williams' drug court is different from most is how punitive it
is.  Such long jail sentences are contrary to the philosophy of drug court,
as well as the guidelines of the National Association of Drug Court
Professionals.  For violating drug court rules, Lindsey not only does jail
terms of 51 days, 90 days and 104 days, Judge Williams sends her on what she
calls an "indefinite sentence," where she did not specify when Lindsey would
get out. (30 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
We hear about how Brandi Byrd and many other offenders end up in Judge Williams' drug court. One reason drug courts were created was to save money by incarcerating fewer people. But in Judge Williams' program, people like Brandi end up in drug court—at a cost of $350 per month—who would've simply gotten probation in most other Georgia counties. When offenders like Brandi are kicked out of the program—and half of participants in Judge Williams' drug court program don't successfully complete it—they go into detention, at a cost of $17,000 per year. Brandi did two years. We also hear how one model drug court participant, Charlie McCullough, was treated by Judge Williams. (25 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>When things are awkward or uncomfortable or distressing, a lot of times it's easier to not think about it. This week we have stories of people pretending that everything is okay and ignoring the awful stuff that's staring them straight in the face. Including a story of deceit and intrigue involving commemorative spoons from the Kennedy Center.

Prologue
Ira speaks with Middle East specialist Michelle Dunne to answer this question: Before the recent Arab uprisings, just how hard was the US pushing the government of Egypt to enact human rights reforms? (7 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
When he was a kid, Josh Martin's mother Nancy told him that if anything
ever happened to her, he needed to take care of his brother Ben. This confused
Josh, because Ben was his older brother, and he felt that if anything he
should be the one taken care of. And years later, when something did happen to
Nancy, following through on that request ended up being more complicated
than Josh - and his other brother Matthew - could ever have imagined.
Producer Lisa Pollak tells the story. (23 1/2 minutes) _Lisa Pollak_

Act Two
In the wake of the tsunami and nuclear disaster at Fukushima, some people suspected that Japanese government officials have not been forthcoming about the actual level of danger from radiation. No one, however, is suggesting a cover-up as extreme as what happened in the Soviet Union after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster. A book called Voices from Chernobyl , written by Svetlana Alexievich and translated by Keith Gessin, has unusually poignant interviews with people impacted by the disaster. Actors Sarah Mollo-Christensen and Kelly Coffield Park read excerpts. (13 1/2 minutes) _Svetlana Alexievich, Kelly Coffield, Sarah Mollo-Christensen_

Act Three
In the 1970s, Dave Kestenbaum's cousin Dan Weiss got promoted from stocker to gift shop manager at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington DC. It was a good job... except for the fact that the place was bleeding cash because of apparent embezzlement. The gift shop staff? Almost all senior citizen volunteers. Dave is a reporter with NPR's Planet Money . (10 minutes) _David Kestenbaum_

      <description>When is it time to walk away, and when is it time to run? This week we have the story of an entire country deciding whether to give up on just one of its citizens, when to hold 'em in order to win nearly a million dollars in poker, and a new story from Dave Dickerson.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass speaks with Jim McManus, whose book Positively Fifth Street inspired Ira to start playing poker. Jim talks about holding and folding, why a poker novice is sometimes the toughest player to beat...and the Cuban Missile Crisis. (8 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
David Ellis Dickerson tells the story of heading home to Tucson after six years away, having rejected the evangelical Christianity of his family. David came prepared for war, armed with new beliefs. But his family had something else in mind. David is author of the memoir House of Cards . (11 1/2 minutes) _David Ellis Dickerson_

Act Two
Producer Nancy Updike shares a pattern that she's noticed recently: eleven steps that Middle Eastern dictators have been taking on the path to losing power. (7 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Three
One of the principles of treating alcoholism is that there's hope for everyone. You never fold your cards. But there are also places known as "wet houses," controversial shelters for alcoholics where they are allowed to keep drinking. Reporter Marc Sanchez visited St. Anthony House, a wet house in St. Paul, to learn how it works. Marc is a producer at Minnesota Public Radio , where he works on a feature called " Minnesota Sounds ." (10 1/2 minutes) _Marc Sanchez_

Act Four
There's a part of Brazil that was almost all rainforest until the 1970s, and over the next few decades a million people moved in, cutting down the forest and building towns and cities. Monte Reel was the South American correspondent for the Washington Post in the mid 1990s, when he started hearing rumors of a "wild man," the last member of a tribe, who lived completely alone in this area's remaining forest. Reel's book about the quest to find and save this man is called The Last of the Tribe . The book also has a video trailer . (14 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>Stories where the fine print changes everything, whether you read it or not.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks about the infamous line in the band Van Halen's contract insisting that the groups' dressing room include a bowl of M&Ms with all the brown M&Ms removed. Ira used to think this request was just petulant rock-star behavior. Then he talked to John Flansburgh, from the band They Might Be Giants , and John explained why the M&M clause was actually an ingenious business strategy. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass, They Might Be Giants_

Act Two
David Rakoff tells the story of a contract between a son and his visiting mother. David Rakoff is the author of several books including Half Empty . (5 minutes) _David Rakoff_

Act Three
In Tehran in 2004, Omid Memarian confessed to doing things he'd never done, meeting people he'd never met, following plots he'd never heard of. Why he did that, and why a lot of other people have confessed to the same things, is all in the fine print. This American Life producer Nancy Updike tells the story. (22 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Four
Susan Burton rereads her parents' divorce papers—the fine print that changed her life forever. (7 minutes) _Susan Burton_

      <description>This week we're trying something we've never tried before: An hour of stories about...this week. We take a crack at major news events, like what's happening in Egypt; and at the most minor, like an 8-year-old who's finally taking the training wheels off her bike. The stories are united by one thing: They all happened in the seven days prior to broadcast.

Prologue
Ira tells what happened this week to Dan Curry in Odessa Texas on Wednesday, to eight-year-old Ruby Melman on Sunday in New Jersey, to Beau O'Reilly at a bike store in Chicago on Saturday, to Theodosha Alexander at the World Trade Center site on Thursday, to Dr. Wade Gordon in Afghanistan on Thursday, to a high school class at the Grand Canyon on Wednesday, and at a bar in New York City on Saturday. (8 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Sarah Koenig talks with Lexi Belculfine, who tries to explain why she and her peers had such a loud, excited reaction to the news of Osama Bin Laden's death, a much more visibly emotional reaction than people over thirty. (5 minutes) _Sarah Koenig_

Act Two
Nancy Updike reports from Cairo, Egypt about what people were doing there this week, namely: going to meetings to create their new democracy. (11 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Three
Ira plays a recorded example of American-style democracy, a school board meeting in Tucson, recorded by a high school teacher, Sarah Bromer. (4 minutes) _Sarah Bromer_

Act Four
Ira tells what happened this week to Shirley Everett-Dicko in Oakland on Sunday, to Gabe and Kevin in Brooklyn on Saturday, to Eric and Roz in Stevens Point, Wisconsin on Wednesday night at midnight, and (in the podcast version of the show) to Eugene Rand and Bill True, on Monday in South Portland, Maine. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Five
This week Southerners were still digging out in the wake of last week's tornados. David Kestenbaum, from our Planet Money team, heads to Tuscaloosa, Alabama where he finds that facts are not so easy to hold onto. (7 minutes) _David Kestenbaum, Planet Money_

Act Six
Thursday night was a make-or-break evening for candidate Herman Cain at the first Republican Presidential debate. Robert Smith from our Planet Money team talked to him about his strategy. Planet Money is a co-production of NPR News and This American Life . (6 minutes) _Planet Money, Robert Smith_

Act Seven
On Saturday, Laura Hucke graduated from the University of Florida in Gainesville. The next day she made a trip that four years ago she didn't think she'd have to make. _Eric Mennel_

      <description>It seems like every politician has a plan for putting people back to work. But we and thePlanet Moneyteam couldn’t help but wonder…how do you create a job? Can politicians truly create many jobs? Is it possible the whole thing is just well-intentioned hot air?

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks to Governor Jay Nixon of Missouri on a press conference he held to announce the creation of just one job. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Chana Joffe-Walt visits a governor who first became famous for promising his
state he'd create jobs: Scott Walker of Wisconsin. (Yes, he's famous for
some other things since.) Walker promised 250,000 new jobs and 10,000 new
business in his state by the end of his first term. Chana tries to figure
out how he's doing.  And whether he can really take credit for the new jobs
that've been created in Wisconsin. (19 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt_

Act Two
In this terrible economy, we wanted to hear the sound of someone actually getting a job, and producer Lisa Pollak recorded it in the Holland Michigan office of Novo 1.  On Tuesday of this week, Deborah Ozga was interviewing applicants for 15 new call center jobs. (7 minutes) _Lisa Pollak_

Act Three
For a look at the nuts and bolts of government job creation, This American Life Senior Producer Julie Snyder and Planet Money correspondent Adam Davidson attend a meeting of the International Economic Developers Council in San Diego. (15 minutes) _Adam Davidson, Planet Money, Julie Snyder_

Act Four
Unemployment is 9 percent, but it's worst among high school dropouts and
people with only a high school education.  Adam went to a place that's
trying to help them find jobs: an organization called Pathstone, in
Rochester, NY. (8 minutes) _Adam Davidson_

      <description>We heard about a test that could determine if someone was a psychopath. So, naturally, our staff decided to take it.

Prologue
Ira explains that when the radio staff decided to take a test that reveals who is a psychopath, very quickly everyone came to believe that the highest score would go to either Robyn, Jane, or him. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Alix Spiegel tells the story of Robert Dixon, who's in a maximum security prison in Vacaville California and is unlikely to ever get parole because of his score on the psychopath test. The test also is called "the checklist" or, more formally, the PCL-R, which stands for "Psychopathy Check List—Revised." Alix tells the story of its creation and reports that the man who created the test, Bob Hare, is concerned at how it's being used today in the criminal justice system. A version of this story aired on NPR's All Things Considered . (28 minutes) _Alix Spiegel_

Act Two
Jon Ronson investigates whether corporate leaders can, in fact, be psychopaths by visiting a former Sunbeam CEO named Al Dunlap. This is an excerpt from Ronson's book, The Psychopath Test . (15 minutes) _Jon Ronson_

Act Three
Ira and the radio show staff get their results on the psychopath test from Dr. David Bernstein, of Forensic Consultants, LLC. , who administered the test to them. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>Stories about standing up to the man—or, really, the men. Nurses at a small Texas hospital report a well-connected doctor for dangerous medical practices, and find themselves under arrest. Plus...how political operators in Chicago get to be judges.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass speaks with former FBI agent Bill Tobin about police collusion with organized crime in 1970s Chicago. It turns out that old boys networks like the mob pull in good and bad cops alike. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
In a small west Texas town called Kermit, two nurses were accused of harassment after they complained to the medical board that a doctor was putting patients in danger. The nurses were fired and then arrested, facing ten years in prison. Reporter Saul Elbein found that a group of powerful men in Kermit went to extreme and sometimes ridiculous lengths to try to bring down these nurses.

      <description>A professor in Pennsylvania makes a calculation, to discover that his state is sitting atop a massive reserve of natural gas—enough to revolutionize how America gets its energy. But another professor in Pennsylvania does a different calculation and reaches a troubling conclusion: that getting natural gas out of the ground poses a risk to public health. Two men, two calculations, and two very different consequences.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass tells the stories of two professors, each making a calculation that no one had made before.  One gets acclaim.  One ends up out of a job.  The first, Terry Engelder, a geologist at Penn State, was estimating the amount of natural gas that's recoverable from the Marcellus shale, a giant rock formation that's under Pennsylvania and several other Eastern states.  The
second, Conrad "Dan" Volz, at the University of Pittsburgh, estimated how much toxic crap—chemicals and pollution from gas exploration—might be getting into water supplies. (6 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Producer Sarah Koenig continues the story Terry Engelder and Dan Volz, their rival calculations about natural gas in Pennsylvania, and how each was treated by his university. She explains how Pennsylvania's universities, politicans and industry have united to develop natural gas.  Other states have been more cautious.  (26 1/2 minutes) _Sarah Koenig_

Act Two
Sarah takes us to Mt. Pleasant, PA, where a gas exploration company called Range Resources has leased 95% of the township's land. This led to a standoff between Mt. Pleasant and Range, starting with zoning disputes and ending in a full scale PR war—a war in which the town was seriously outgunned. (23 1/2 minutes) _Sarah Koenig_

      <description>Why would a company rent an office in a tiny town in East Texas, put a nameplate on the door, and leave it completely empty for a year? The answer involves a controversial billionaire physicist in Seattle, a 40 pound cookbook, and a war waging right now, all across the software and tech industries. We take you inside this war, and tell the fascinating story of how an idea enshrined in the US constitution to promote progress and innovation, is now being used to do the opposite.

Prologue
There's a derogatory term in Silicon Valley for companies that amass huge troves of patents and make money by threatening lawsuits: "patent trolls."  When Jeff Kelling's Internet company Fototime was sued - along with more than 130 other companies - for violating someone's patent, he wondered if it was a troll (which the company denies), and then settled out of court. (8 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
NPR reporter Laura Sydell and This American Life producer/ Planet Money co-host Alex Blumberg tell the story of Intellectual Ventures , which is accused of being the largest of the patent trolls. The investigation takes them to a small town in Texas, where they find a hallway full of empty companies with no employees. (29 minutes) _Alex Blumberg, Laura Sydell_

Act Two
Laura and Alex continue their story about Intellectual Ventures and the practice of patent trolling. They learn why the buying and selling of patents is likely to continue being a huge, controversial business that affects the entire tech industry. Correction: The broadcast version of this story misidentified one of the winning bidders of Nortel's patents as Nokia instead of Ericsson. (23 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

      <description>Like a lot of Mexican towns, Florencia has had its share of problems dealing with drug gangs. That is until recently, when new narcos rolled into town telling residents that they were there to liberate them. They promised that people would live in peace and tranquility. And so far, it's working. As long as the narcos are on the streets with guns, people feel safe. That and other stories of thugs.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass tells the story of Florencia de Benito Juarez, a small town in Mexico where a new drug gang recently took over. They promised peace and tranquility, and for the most part, they're making good on those promises. Thugs: keeping order. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
"Thug" is a very imprecise word. And as producer Nancy Updike explains, the subjectivity of its meaning has been particularly apparent during the recent revolution in Egypt. Translations in this story are read by actor Michael Chernus . (17 minutes) _Michael Chernus, Nancy Updike_

Act Two
Reporter Laura Beil tells the story of a kid named Kenneth Williams and an adult named Ton'Nea Williams (who share a last name but are not related). Ton'Nea has been stuck with this question: is Kenneth a thug or not? (30 minutes) _Laura Beil_

      <description>We head to some of the happiest places on earth: amusement parks! Ira Glass takes us behind the scenes at Worlds of Fun in Kansas City, where the young staff – coached by a funny, fun-loving boss just a little older than they are – truly seem to love their jobs.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass walks through a Kansas City Missouri amusement park called Worlds of Fun with Cole Lindbergh, who had a season pass to the park as a little kid, starting working there summers at 14, and then just stayed. Now he's a full-time, year-round employee, running the games department. It's possible he does this job better than anyone in the country. It's rare to witness someone so happily great at his job. (9 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Ira continues with Cole Lindbergh and the hundred teenagers who work for him
in the games department at Worlds of Fun.  We watch them compete against
each other to see who can do the most business, in Cole's Sweet Sixteen
bracket tournament, which pits all 32 games in the park against each other.
We hear about all the things Cole does that other games managers don't.  He
invents games. He directs music videos starring his team. Cole's Worlds of Fun videos mentioned in Act One: Play My Games Music Video I'm in a Game Music Video (The sequel: note how it starts where Play My Games ends) Training Video Sci Fi Special Effects Film (Yes, there's a two minute credit sequence/prologue before the action
starts) Others! (23 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
We asked for your stories about amusement parks.  Three hundred of you
called in, with stories of fear, floating carnies and, um, vomit. (9 minutes) _Jane Feltes, Ira Glass_

Act Three
Jonathan Goldstein returns to Wildwood, New Jersey, where he spent one not-fateful summer when he was sixteen. Jonathan's the host of the podcast Heavyweight . (13 minutes) _Jonathan Goldstein_

      <description>This week, Sarah Koenig hosts, as we tackle the thing we all hate to love: Gossip. That's right; we've got rumor, we've got innuendo, and we've got a story of gossipers gone pro. Sarah even makes a compelling case that in some places, gossip could very well be saving lives. But you didn't hear it from us.

Prologue
Senior producer Julie Snyder and her husband Jeff talk to guest host Sarah Koenig about gossip that takes place—where else?—in a beauty salon. (8 minutes) _Sarah Koenig_

Act One
In Malawi, in southeast Africa, not gossiping can be worse than gossiping. Sarah interviews a young Malawian woman named Hazel Namandingo, who explains that because so many people have HIV and AIDS in Malawi, they often rely on gossip to figure out who's safe to date or marry. It turns out this kind of gossip is the basis for a huge research project about AIDS in Malawi. For 10 years, a sociologist named Susan Watkins has been collecting journals filled with gossip about AIDS. Watkins hired local people to write the journals—to just listen to what people were saying in their communities about the virus, and then write it down. What Watkins learned from reading them bucked much of the conventional wisdom about how rural Africans were dealing with the epidemic. (Plus, they're really entertaining.) There's a U Penn website that explains the Malawi Journals Project. And an NGO in Malawi called Invest in Knowledge has catalogued the journals. (30 minutes) _Sarah Koenig_

Act Two
Chicago writer Rebecca Makkai bring us the story of a reality television producer attempting to gossip love into existence—and just how complicated that gets. This fiction story originally appeared in the journal Crazyhorse . Rebecca is the author of the novel The Borrower , and "The November Story" is part of her collection-in-progress Music for Wartime . (18 minutes) _Rebecca Makkai_

      <description>In this show, we return to people who've been onThis American Lifein the last ten years, whose lives were drastically altered by 9/11, including Hyder Akbar, an Afghan-American teen who moved to Afghanistan after his father was tapped to become governor of Kunar province there. And Marian Fontana, whose husband Dave was a firefighter who died in the Twin Towers; and Lynn Simpson, who escaped from the 89th floor and made it out of the World Trade Center with about a minute to spare.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks to someone who escaped from the twin towers with a minute to spare and someone who lost her husband on 9/11. Both say they try to avoid 9/11 commemorations. If that's true, then who are they for? (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Hyder Akbar was a teenager living with his family in the Bay Area when president Hamid Karzai asked Hyder's dad to return to Afghanistan and become an official in the new government. Hyder recorded audio diaries that became two episodes of our show, in 2002 and 2003 , both produced by Susan Burton . They also wrote a book . Ira checks in with Hyder, who is now an adult living and working in Afghanistan. (18 minutes) _Susan Burton_

Act Two
Marian Fontana, whose husband was a firefighter who died on 9/11, originally appeared on our show in 2005 . Ira talks with Marian today, about what has changed for her over the last 10 years. Marian wrote a book called A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11 , and is at work on a new book. (10 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
In 2008 , reporter Chris Neary told the story of John, a soldier who returned from tours of Iraq and Afghanistan with severe PTSD, and ended up attacking his fiancee and her mother. Chris finds out how John is coping today. (6 1/2 minutes) _Chris Neary_

Act Four
The podcast and stream versions of the show include a story here that is not included in broadcast. It catches us up with an Iraqi translator named Basim, who fled the country to Norway after his life was threatened because he aided the American forces. The original ran in 2007 . _Ira Glass_

Act Five
Alix Spiegel revisits a story she reported in 2006 - which caused more listeners to email us than any other story we've broadcast. It was about a Muslim American girl named "Chloe," who was tormented at school after the students had a lesson on 9/11. Alix is a correspondent for NPR News. A Correction: In this story, we accidentally misreported a statistic. We stated that according to FBI statistics, about 10 percent of hate crimes in 2009 were against Muslims. In fact, about 10 percent of religiously-motivated hate crimes were against Muslims. It was 128 of the 1,376 religiously-motivated hate crimes that year (9.3 percent). In all, there were 7,789 hate crime offenses in 2009, so incidents against Muslims were 1.6% of the total, which is tiny. That same year, there were 2,724 hate crimes against Black people, 798 hate crimes against gay men and 964 hate crimes against Jews, according to the FBI. A table of the data is here on the FBI's website. Our reporter misread this summary . We're grateful to the listener who emailed and pointed this out, Robert Ben Garant. (10 minutes) _Alix Spiegel_

Act Six
On 9/11, Lynn Simpson escaped from the 89th floor of the World Trade Center. Ira talks with her about what's changed since she first appeared on the show, just a week after the attacks in 2001 . Here are some other past This American Life episodes and stories relating to 9/11 and its aftermath: Habeas Schmabeas (winner of the 2006 Peabody Award) Before and After (our first show post 9/11, about what happened) Somewhere in the Arabian Sea This American Wife Secret Government I'm From the Private Sector and I'm Here to Help (about private contractors) The Arms Trader The Prosecutor 1001 Arabian Nightly Newscasts Froggy Goes A-Courtin' Some of the many stories and shows we've done about Iraq: Why We Fight (on the debate over whether to invade Iraq) The Balloon Goes Up (the start of the war) Johnny Get Your Mouse In Country What Happens in Baghdad, Stays in Baghdad The Center for Lessons Learned Mr. Adam's Neighborhood Ask an Iraqi Will They Know Me Back Home? Iraq After Us (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Their publicist invited a reporter named Pete Crooks from Diablo magazine to do a ride-along with the P.I. Moms on a case. Pete thinks it'll be a simple, fun assignment. Turns out he was wrong. (4 mins) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Joshuah Bearman tells the story of Pete's ridealong with the PI Moms, and how strange things started to happen. As he dug deeper into their operations, he learned about cases like the Candyman, where everything gets oddly and unnecessarily complicated. And he learns about the involvement of Norm Wielsch, the top drug enforcement officer in Contra Costa County. He starts to get mysterious emails from an anonymous source who calls himself "Rutherford." (29 minutes) _Josh Bearman_

Act Two
Joshuah Bearman's story continues. Chris Butler makes a transition into true criminal behavior. Someone rats Chris out. The truth emerges. (21 minutes) _Josh Bearman_

      <description>Sometimes you choose the adventure and sometimes the adventure chooses you. This week, stories that pinpoint when people's boring old lives turn into something wildly unfamiliar. Including a story of one young man's time served in a Chinese prison, and a handful of adventure stories from some of our favorite writers.

Prologue
We sent a reporter named Dan Grech to the Hundred Year Starship Public Symposium , which aims to tackle the technological problems related to interstellar space travel. And as host Ira Glass explains, Dan found this gathering to be way more adventurous than your average scientific conference. (6 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Some adventures you seek out on purpose, and others hunt you down. Producer Alex Blumberg tells this story, about the experience a guy had in China...which started out as first kind of adventure, then quickly turned into the second kind. Alex is one of the creators of Planet Money . (23 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

Act Two
Any adventure show would be incomplete without some swashbuckling, dinosaur-chasing, time-traveling madness. So we asked a few of our favorite writers to offer up short stories. Dave Eggers , Jeanne Darst , Wendy McClure , Fiona Maazel and Neil Gaiman answered the call. The first four stories are fiction. Neil's is autobiographical. Wendy's story is read by Cristin Milioti . Fiona's is read by John Conlee . The others are read by the writers themselves. (26 minutes) _John Conlee, Jeanne Darst, Dave Eggers, Neil Gaiman, Fiona Maazel, Wendy McClure, Cristin Milioti_

      <description>This week, at the suggestion of a 14-year-old listener, we bring you stories from the awkward, confusing, hormonally charged world of middle school. Including a teacher who transforms peer pressure into a force for good, and reports from the frontlines of the middle school dance.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass interviews a 14-year old named Annie, who emailed us asking if we would do a show about middle school. She explains why exactly the middle school years can be so daunting. (4 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
In an effort to understand the physical and emotional changes middle school kids experience, Ira speaks with reporter Linda Perlstein , who wrote a book called Not Much Just Chillin' about a year she spent following five middle schoolers. Then we hear from producer Alex Blumberg, who was a middle school teacher in Chicago for four years before getting into radio. Alex's takeaway? We shouldn't even try teaching kids at this age. Marion Strok, principal of a successful Chicago school, disagrees. (6 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
We sent several correspondents straight to the epicenters of middle school awkwardness: School dances. Producers Lisa Pollak and Brian Reed, plus reporters Eric Mennel, Rob Wildeboer and Claire Holman spoke with kids across the country during the nervous moments leading up to the dances. And Lisa even ventured inside, to the dance itself.
(9 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass, Lisa Pollak_

Act Three
When Domingo Martinez was growing up in a Mexican-American family in Texas, Domingo's two middle school aged sisters found a unique way of coping with feelings of inferiority. This story comes from Martinez's memoir The Boy Kings of Texas . (11 1/2 minutes) _Domingo Martinez_

Act Four
We realized that there are already reporters on the ground, embedded inside middle schools: The kids who report the daily announcements, sometimes on video with full newscast sets. Producer Jonathan Menjivar wondered what would happen if instead of announcing sports scores and the daily cafeteria menu, the kids reported what's really on their minds. Students at Parkville Middle School outside Baltimore, and their journalism teacher Ms. Davis, agreed to try out this experiment. (7 1/2 minutes) _Jonathan Menjivar_

Act Five
Producer Sarah Koenig reports on a kid we'll call Leo, whose family moved away from Rochester, NY, leaving behind all of Leo's friends and
stranding him in a new — and in his opinion, much worse — middle school. (10 minutes) _Sarah Koenig_

Act Six
Ira speaks with Shannon Grande, a teacher at Rise Academy in Newark, about a seventh grader who had all sorts of problems with behavior and hygiene and schoolwork. In order to help turn him around, Grande had to harness the power of peer pressure for good. This story came from Elizabeth Green, author of the book Building a Better Teacher . (7 minutes)

      <description>A few years ago a cancer researcher named Jonathan Brody gave a speech at his alma mater saying that people in his field really needed to think outside the box to find a cure. Afterward he was approached by his old orchestra teacher, who had something way out of the box—a theory that he could kill cancer cells with electromagnetic waves. And other stories.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with science writer Paul Hoffman about a mathematician named Frank Nelson Cole, who demonstrated a groundbreaking idea at a conference in 1903. Paul explains that in addition to their celebrated breakthroughs, many of the greatest thinkers in history have entertained some very crazy ideas. Paul is the author of many books including The Man Who Loved Only Numbers , and is director of the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
One day a successful cancer researcher named Jonathan Brody gave a talk at his alma mater, about how people in his field need to think outside the box if they're going to find a cure. Afterward Jonathan's old music teacher Anthony Holland shared an idea that was way out of the box: Killing cancer cells with electromagnetic waves. Gabriel Rhodes tells what happened next. Gabriel is also working on a documentary film version of this story, called The Cure . Correction : Ira writes—In an edit of Gabriel Rhodes's story, I mistakenly asked him to insert erroneous information about sound waves and electromagnetic waves, and then acted so completely confident about it—misremembering a science show I worked on years ago—that nobody in the editing process bothered to fact check it. The people in the story were using electromagnetic waves, not sound waves, for their experiment. This was very much my mistake and not Gabe's, and I regret telling him to insert a mistake into his otherwise carefully researched and fact checked story. Thanks to the many listeners who wrote to point out the error. We've gone back and fixed this, so the versions aired in 2012 and posted here on the website have the correction. (35 minutes) _Gabriel Rhodes_

Act Two
Ira Glass speaks with a guy named Benny, who came up with a crazy idea for how to deal with a crush. And in its own way, this crazy idea worked. (13 1/2 minutes)

      <description>In the wake of the recent news, listeners have contacted us and tweeted about the show we did two years ago at Penn State,#1 Party School. We listen again to some of those stories, with new interviews recorded this past week, as Penn State fans and loyalists try to make sense of the actions of Coach Joe Paterno and school officials.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass revisits some interviews done with Penn State students in 2009, long before the sex abuse scandal that's engulfed the football team and led to the resignation of its legendary coach, as well as the university's President.  Back in 2009, students said that the best thing about Penn State football is the high moral standard upheld by the team and its coaches. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Sarah Koenig attended last weekend's Penn State game, the last home game of the season, with Michael Winereb and his parents. Weinreb grew up in State College, and has written several widely circulated columns for the website Grantland about his reactions to the recent scandal. Here are the first , the second and the third . He went to the game worrying that Joe Paterno and the team are so embedded into his childhood memories and experiences, that the recent news will actually rip at his own feelings about his past. Sarah also talks with other State College residents who are struggling to make sense of the news. (21 minutes) _Sarah Koenig_

Act Two
We hear excerpts from our 2009 episode that was recorded at Penn State. Though the focus of that episode was student drinking and partying, we hear how much of the culture of the school is organized around football and how deeply people loved the team and Coach Joe Paterno. All this helps explain the disappointment, confusion and violence we've seen at State College in the wake of the grand jury report. As part of this act, we hear a new interview with from Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Frank Fitzpatrick, whose investigation of Penn State football's finances was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. (29 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>We bring you our sort-of-annual holiday tradition: The Poultry Slam! Stories of what happens when humans and fowl collide, including the tale of one notorious turkey who unleashed a long reign of terror on an unsuspecting neighborhood.

Prologue
Ira Glass talks with Scharlette Holdman, who works with defense teams on high profile death row cases, and who has not talked to a reporter in more than 25 years. Why did she suddenly end the moratorium on press? Because her story is about something important: Namely, a beautiful chicken.
(2 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Scharlette Holdman's story continues, in which she and the rest of a legal
defense team try to save a man on death row by finding a star witness — a
chicken with a specific skill.
(10 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
The number of wild turkeys in the United States has risen from 30,000 at the
beginning of the 20th century to an estimated seven million today. And it's
common for them to get aggressive with people. But the average turkey
doesn't come close to the reign of terror unleashed by one particular
turkey, named Tom, on Martha's Vinyard in 2008. Sam Bungey tells the story. (15 minutes) _Sam Bungey_

Act Three
In order to make foie gras — goose liver — the birds have to be treated inhumanely, strapped down and force-fed huge amounts of food. So when a chef named Dan Barber heard about Eduardo Sousa, a Spaniard who had supposedly found a way to make foie gras without mistreating the animals, Dan didn't believe it ... until he went to Spain to investigate. Dan runs the New York restaurant Blue Hill . (20 minutes)

      <description>This week, stories where a longtime standoff keeps both sides coming back for more. Including a story about the time in Poland's recent history where the country's two political blocks came together and believed, however briefly, they'd be able to set aside their differences. And another story about a college rivalry gone viral, and personal.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass speaks with Columbia University professor Peter Coleman , who shares some surprising details about the battle surrounding the abortion debate in Boston during the 1990s. We learn what secret meetings between the warring groups could accomplish, and what they couldn't. Coleman wrote about this topic in his book The Five Percent: Finding Solutions to Seemingly Impossible Conflicts ." (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
After a 2010 plane crash killed dozens of Polish dignitaries, including the president, some thought that the country would cross the political rift and come together to mourn. Reporter Amy Drozdowska-McGuire tells what happened instead. (26 minutes) _Amy Drozdowska-McGuire_

Act Two
When Chris Gethard was attending a run-down Rutgers University in the late 1990s, another student down the way—at a university called Princeton—became his nemesis. This is the title story of Chris's book A Bad Idea I'm About to Do , which comes out in January. He also hosts The Chris Gethard Show , a public access TV talk show. (20 minutes)

      <description>If you're like us, when the words "European debt crisis" pop up in the news you feel a little worried, and a little like taking a nap. Turns out, there's a story behind this story. One that's filled with guilt, and drama, and betrayal, and 100-year-old dreams come true. Alex Blumberg ofPlanet Moneyguest hosts.

Prologue
Ira Glass asks guest host Alex Blumberg whether we should really care about the current European debt crisis. The answer: yes, we should, and we should WANT to care too, because this story—and it's actually the story of the Euro itself—is very surprising and dramatic. This hour, Alex and the Planet Money team helm the show. (3 minutes) _Alex Blumberg, Chana Joffe-Walt, Planet Money_

Act One
Planet Money reporters Chana Joffe-Walt and Zoe Chace tells the story of the far-fetched, 150 year-old dream of a universal European currency.
(13 1/2 minutes)

Act Two
When the Euro arrived in 2002, the BBC called it "the most ambitious
financial and political change since money began." Here in the US we don't
think of it as that revolutionary, but in Europe it truly changed how
millions of people lived. Adam Davidson and Chana Joffe-Walt report.
(22 1/2 minutes)

Act Three
Adam and Chana tell how things turned dramatically worse for the Euro in
2009, when the new government in Greece announced that its national deficit
was twice what the previous government had reported.
(6 1/2 minutes)

Act Four
Chana and Alex tell what happened next, when technocrats in Germany and
other solvent European countries tried to fix the crisis by actually
enforcing the original rules for Euro Zone membership. It turned out that
even determining the real deficit in Greece was no easy task.
(9 1/2 minutes)

Act Five
Chana and Alex explain that when people talk about Greece today, they're really talking about Italy...meaning, where will the crisis hit next? And is it going to hit the US? (10 1/2 minutes)

      <description>Alabama's new immigration law aims to make life so difficult for illegal immigrants that they will "self-deport." And in a way it's working. Immigrants are fleeing Alabama...but not just the undocumented ones. This and other stories of people living with the unintended consequences of their decisions.

Prologue
Ira plays tape of a man whose job is plowing snow. He'll plow your driveway for money...or, if you're extra nice, he'll do it for free without even mentioning it. And if you're a jerk, well, he's got an answer for that too. He was interviewed by producer Jonathan Menjivar.
(3 1/2 minutes) _Jonathan Menjivar_

Act One
Last Summer, Alabama passed HB56, the most sweeping immigration bill in the country. It's an example of a strategy called "attrition through enforcement" or, more colloquially, "self-deportation"--making life so hard on undocumented immigrants that they choose to leave the country. But as reporter Jack Hitt found, the new law has had lots of other unintended
consequences. Jack has a book coming out this Spring called Bunch of Amateurs. (35 minutes) _Jack Hitt_

Act Two
Comedian Danny Lobell tells this story about the unintended consequences of bringing new residents to his Brooklyn neighborhood. Namely, a couple of chickens. (16 minutes) _Danny Lobell_

      <description>Love makes us do crazy things. But not this crazy. This week for Valentine's Day we have stories of people going to extremes as they fall in love, chase love down, and try to make sense of it—including a teenager who falls for an undercover cop, and epic tales of snooping.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass speaks with musician Kristy Kruger about the unique way she dealt with a recent breakup. (4 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Kurt Braunohler and his girlfriend had been together for thirteen years, and they were only 30. They wondered why they had never considered marriage, and realized that they needed to sleep with other people before they tied the knot. Then the adventure began. Kurt is a comedian who co-hosts a variety show called Hot Tub (with Kristen Schaal), will host a game show called Bunk premiering on IFC in June, and has a one man show called The Amish Guide to F*cking . (18 1/2 minutes) _Kurt Braunohler, Ira Glass_

Act Two
At three high schools in Palm Beach County, Florida, several young police officers were sent undercover to pose as students, tasked with making drug arrests. And this, this is the setting for a love story, reported by Robbie Brown . Robbie works for The New York Times in Atlanta. In 2014, Lin-Manuel Miranda turned this reporting into a 14-minute Broadway mini-musical . (13 minutes) _Robbie Brown_

Act Three
Ben Loory wrote and tells this story, which begins with a duck falling in love with a rock. It's in his collection Stories for the Nighttime and Some for the Day . (8 minutes)

Act Four
Jeanne Darst tells a story about that iconic crime of passion: snooping. Jeanne is the author of the memoir Fiction Ruined My Family . Note: the names in this story have been changed. (12 minutes) _Jeanne Darst_

      <description>Stories of people who decide to flip their personalities and do the exact opposite of what they normally do.

Prologue
Ira speaks with a reality TV producer named Bill Langworthy , who has noticed that people do things in front of the camera that they would never, ever do in their actual lives. (3 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
2008 was a hard year for Louis Ortiz. He had lost his job and was playing in pool tournaments in The Bronx to scratch together some money. Then one day a friend pointed out that Louis looked strikingly similar to a man who had been in the news: presidential candidate Barack Obama. And that's when everything started to change for Louis, in ways he could never have expected. The story is told by Ryan Murdock, who is making a documentary film called The Audacity of Louis Ortiz . He's looking for a distributor. (38 minutes) _Ryan Murdock_

Act Two
Kristen Finch was a speech therapist who sometimes worked with kids with Asperger Syndrome, symptoms of which include emotional distance, inflexibility and missing social cues. Kristin and her co-workers often joked that all their husbands had Asperger's, since the symptoms overlap with stereotypically male personality traits. But then Kristen wondered—what if it was actually true for her husband Dave? The quiz that Dave Finch took to determine whether he had Aspergers can be found online (note: it's not an official diagnostic tool). Dave wrote a book about this experience, called The Journal of Best Practices . (15 1/2 minutes)

      <description>All across the country right now, local and state governments are finding they can't pay their bills. Schools are losing teachers, street lights are going dark, garbage is piling up in public parks, and cops are suddenly an optional expense.

Prologue
In the town of Nowthen, MN, residents held meetings to debate whether a police force is worth the cost. And in Springfield, IL, the state police motorcycle division has been cut, leading to an increase in highway fatalities. Host Ira Glass talks about these and other examples of the battle between proponents of small government and those fighting to maintain public services. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
New Jersey governor Chris Christie has led some of the most sweeping budget cuts in the country. Producer Sarah Koenig reports from Trenton, where one third of the police force has been laid off, leading to dramatically increased crime.  (14 1/2 minutes) _Sarah Koenig_

Act Two
Perhaps the biggest proponent of smaller government in the United States is lobbyist and activist Grover Norquist , head of Americans for Tax Reform . He envisions a government reduced in size by half, and has compelled scores of conservative politicians take pledges to never raise taxes. Host Ira Glass speaks with Norquist about his strategies and beliefs, and learns which side seems to be winning. (14 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
After the recession hit, Colorado Springs was in rough shape. City services were being cut left and right. Then one man wrote a manifesto—a blueprint for how the city could solve its problems. Planet Money 's Robert Smith tells the story. Robert is a member of the Planet Money team. (27 minutes) _Robert Smith_

      <description>We've discovered that one of our most popular episodes contained numerous fabrications. This week, we detail the errors inMike Daisey's story about visiting Foxconn, which makes iPads and other products for Apple in China.Marketplace'sChina correspondentRob Schmitzdiscovered the fabrications.Transcript.Press Release.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass tells listeners we can no longer stand behind the reporting in the recently aired episode " Mr. Daisey Goes to the Apple Factory ." He explains how Marketplace reporter Rob Schmitz tracked down Daisey's interpreter in China — a woman named Cathy Lee — who disputes much of Daisey's story. And Ira talks about how Mike Daisey lied to TAL during the fact-checking process, telling Ira and our producers that Cathy was not her real name and that she was unreachable. Ira also stresses that, without Cathy's corroboration of the story, This American Life never should have run the story in the first place.. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Rob Schmitz , a Shanghai-based reporter for Marketplace , tracks down and interviews Cathy Lee, Mike Daisey's interpreter on his trip to Shenzhen, China, and the Foxconn factory. In her interview with Rob, Cathy disputes much of what Daisey has been telling theater audiences since 2010 and much of what he said on the radio. Rob also talks to Mike Daisey about Cathy's version of the trip and tries to square the two accounts.. (21 minutes) _Rob Schmitz_

Act Two
Host Ira Glass has a lot of questions for Mike Daisey, beginning with why Daisey lied to Ira and This American Life producer Brian Reed about how they could fact-check his story with Cathy Lee.  Ira also explains This American Life 's fact-checking process, in general.. (15 minutes)

Act Three
To get a sense of what really is true of Apple's working conditions in China, Ira talks to New York Times reporter Charles Duhigg. Duhigg, along with Times reporter David Barboza, wrote the newspaper's front-page investigative series in early 2012 about this subject. And while Duhigg won't tell you how to feel about Apple and its supplier factories' practices, he does lay out the options for how you could feel, in a very clear and logical way. Duhigg is also the author of The Power of Habit .. Here's a longer version of Ira's interview with Charles Duhigg, where he lays out more details about what we know about Apple's manufacturing operations in China. Apple's Supplier Responsibility page Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior (SACOM) reports: October 2010 May 2011 Sept 2011 (12 minutes)

      <description>For anyone who has ever heard the term "Washington insider" and felt outside — we are with you. So this week, we go inside the rooms where the deals get made, to the actual moment that the checks change hands — and we ask the people writing and receiving the checks what, exactly, is the money buying?

Prologue
Host Ira Glass plays a voicemail containing something very common but very
rare to hear: an elected official directly asking a lobbyist for money.. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Planet Money 's Alex Blumberg and NPR Congressional correspondent Andrea Seabrook take a tour through the world of money and politics, discovering just how much time members of Congress spend raising money and which committee assignments yield the biggest campaign donations.

For an interactive map of Washington DC fundraiser locations, charts of the best and worst types of fundraisers, and other online extras, visit Planet Money's website .. (27 minutes) _Alex Blumberg, Andrea Seabrook_

Act Two
Everything about political fundraising is changing right now, because of the 2010 Supreme Court decision in Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission. Since then, "Super PACs" have been able to funnel huge amounts of anonymous money into races. Producer Ben Calhoun shares the example of Ami Bera, whose run for Congress was dramatically affected by money from a Super PAC.. (15 minutes) _Ben Calhoun_

Act Three
Ten years ago, Congress voted to reform campaign finance, after Senators John McCain and Russ Feingold took up the cause. Here they reunite on the radio, to reminisce and lament how that reform failed. Senator Feingold is author of the book While America Sleeps . (7 1/2 minutes).

      <description>Religion makes it pretty clear what differentiates mortal sins from venial ones. Mortal are the really bad sins and venial the lesser ones. But in our everyday lives, it can be really difficult to determine just how bad we've been. This week we have stories of people trying to figure out that question.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass plays tape from a political rally in support of a Chicago politician named Derrick Smith, who had just been arrested for accepting a bribe. His supporters likely believed that Smith had erred...but they also believed that the other candidate was even worse. Then Ira speaks with a Franciscan priest named Father Augustino Torres, to help clarify what separates serious sins — the mortal ones — from the not so serious, venial sins. (9 minutes)

Act One
Producer Alex Blumberg tells the story of Jeff Smith, a former Missouri State Senator who spent last year in federal prison. The story of how Jeff ended up there includes large sins, but begins with a relatively small one. In other words, it's the story of a venial sin turning into a mortal one. Alex can regularly be heard on Planet Money , which is a collaboration between NPR News and This American Life . (33 1/2 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

Act Two
Lying is a sin. But what about the lies that we all collectively believe because they give us hope? Jonathan Goldstein tells this story about confronting the truth. It's based on one of Aesop's fables. Jonthan hosts Wiretap on CBC Radio, and is author of Ladies and Gentlemen: The Bible . (5 minutes) _Jonathan Goldstein_

Act Three
Because the line between a mortal and venial sin can be hazy, sometimes the only way to tell is to test it. And that's particularly true when you're a kid, trying to figure out if you agree with where your parents draw that line. Producer Jonathan Menjivar tells this story about a time when he tested that line. (8 minutes) _Jonathan Menjivar_

Prologue
Host Ira Glass and producer Robyn Semien get a blackjack lesson from Andy Bloch , who played for the MIT blackjack team.

      <description>It used to be that the American expats in China were the big shots. They had the money, the status, the know-how. But that's changed. What's it like to be an American living in China now? And what do they understand about China that we don't?

Prologue
In preparing for this show, we started reaching out to Americans living in China and asking for their stories.  A shocking amount of the expats came back with stories about different times they were on Chinese television.  So many people sent us their China TV stories that we began to wonder, "have ALL of you guys been on TV?!  Is this the consummate expat
experience in China?" Several expats talk to Ira about why the Chinese love foreigners on their TV shows. And Evan Osnos, a staff writer for The New Yorker who writes about China, says it's hard for Americans living in China to figure out what to tell friends and family back home.
(7 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
There are about seventy thousand Americans living in mainland China today, according to the Chinese and US governments. A lot of the Americans in China only stay for a few years, but then there are others — American ex-pats who’ve lived in China for a decade or more with no foreseeable plans to come home. Who are they? And how Chinese do they become? Evan Osnos has this story, which starts with an ex-pat named Kaiser Kuo. Evan is a staff writer at The New Yorker and author of the book Age of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth, and Faith in the New China . (29 minutes) _Evan Osnos_

Act Two
There are so few farmers in the United States that in 1993, the census stopped counting the number of Americans who live on farms at the time. But in China, despite the vast migration to cities in recent years, more than half the country still lives in rural areas. Michael Meyer is a writer whose first book, The Last Days of Old Beijing: Life in the Vanishing Backstreets of a City Transformed detailed his three years living in Beijing’s oldest neighborhood. His newest book, about living in rural China — specifically, in the village his wife comes from — is called In Manchuria . (17 minutes)

      <description>In 2006, a new convert showed up at a mosque in Orange County, California, eager to study the Koran and make new friends. But when he started acting odd and saying strange things, those friends got suspicious. To them, he was Farouk al-Aziz. But his real name was Craig Monteilh, and he was working undercover for the FBI.

Prologue
At a Muslim community center in New York, two lawyers teach a workshop on how to react when an FBI agent shows up at the door asking questions. The workshop is a project of CLEAR — Creating Law Enforcement Accountability and Responsibility — at the City University of New York School of Law. (10 1/2 minutes)

Act One
In the summer of 2006, an FBI official visited a mosque in Orange County, California. His intention was to reassure the community that they weren’t being spied on. But a few months later, an undercover informant named Craig Monteilh showed up at the mosque. Monteilh says he’d been sent there to catch terrorists. But his behavior was so odd that Monteilh himself came under suspicion. Documentary filmmaker Sam Black reports the story. (25 minutes) _Sam  Black_

Act Two
The story of Craig Monteilh continues: What happens when you turn someone in to the FBI who, it turns out, is working for the FBI? Trevor Aaronson, whom Sam Black interviewed for this story, has a book coming out called The Terror Factory . (21 minutes) _Sam  Black_

      <description>Only the clever need apply. This week, stories of people acting on a technicality in the face of some of life's toughest regulators: financial regulators, parents and God.

Prologue
Ira talks with UC Davis Professor Kathy Stuart about a macabre trend that dates back to 17th and 18th century Europe. It seems that in order to avoid eternal damnation for the sin of committing suicide, a number of people began committing murder for the express purpose of turning themselves in, confessing their sins to a priest in order to be blessed and forgiven before being executed. (9 minutes)

Act One
An estate attorney in Rhode Island discovers the investor's Holy Grail: a financial scheme that guarantees only reward and no risk. All upside with no downside. The only catch? You have to die in order to get the money. But there's a loophole! Alex Blumberg from Planet Money and Jake Bernstein from ProPublica tell the story of how the attorney, Joseph Caramadre, figured out how to get someone else to die instead. For a more detailed version of this story plus graphics, documents, video excerpts of the depositions, and a way for you to weigh in on whether it's acceptable to profit from the death of strangers, visit ProPublica's website . _Alex Blumberg_

      <description>As kids and teachers head back to school, we wanted to turn away from questions about politics and unions and money and all the regular school stuff people argue about, and turn to something more optimistic — an emerging theory about what to teach kids, from Paul Tough's bookHow Children Succeed.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks about his experiences reporting on education and the
unending question of how we can make schools better.  He discusses the
Chicago Teachers strike and an essay by writer Alex Kotlowitz that talks
about how the strike raises questions about the severity of this challenge. (4 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Ira talks with Paul Tough, author of the book How Children Succeed , about the traditional ways we measure ability and intelligence in American schools. They talk about the focus on cognitive abilities and conventional "book smarts." They discuss the current emphasis on these kinds of skills in American education, and the emphasis on standardized testing, and then turn our attention to a growing body of research that suggests we may be on the verge of a new approach to some of the biggest challenges facing American schools today. Paul Tough discusses how “non-cognitive skills” — qualities like tenacity, resilience, impulse control — are being viewed as increasingly vital in education, and Ira speaks with economist James Heckman, who’s been at the center of this research and this shift. (38 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Our story picks back up with the question of how non-cognitive skills can be taught to older kids who have gone much longer without learning things like self-control, conscientiousness and resilience. Ira returns to the story of Kewauna, the Chicago teenager, who talks about the dramatic ways in which she changed her life. They discuss an intervention by Kewauna’s family, and the programs that have helped her thrive. Economist James Heckman then discusses they ways in which this shift in emphasis could change the way we practice education and the way we think about learning. (11 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>This week people reach out in all kinds of ways to try to get their point across. And the recipients of those messages try to decipher what they mean. Messages in code, over the phone, and from beyond the grave.

Prologue
Reporter Josh Bearman tells Ira a story about two coded messages that Galileo sent to fellow scientist Johannes Kepler back in the 17th century. Galileo was trying to tell Kepler about some of the amazing discoveries he made with his new telescope. And after months of mind-bending work, Kepler finally decoded the messages.  Eureka! There was only one catch. Kepler was wrong. But he was also kind of right. But also, still, kind of wrong.
(8 mins) _Josh Bearman_

Act One
For generations, the gender of babies born into one family have all been
determined in advance. The pregnant mothers receive a package in the mail,
and if a little pink dress is inside, it's a girl. If there is a pair of
brown polyester old-man pants, it's a boy. Producer Brian Reed reports the
story. (17 minutes)

Act Two
Comedian, performer and author Dave Hill gets the message, loud and clear, from a Gatorade bottle on a subway platform. Dave is the author of Tasteful Nudes ... and Other Misguided Attempts at Personal Growth and Validation . His story was recorded live at Cameo Gallery in Brooklyn. (9 minutes) _Dave Hill_

Act Three
Sonari Glinton tells the story of how a Catholic nun teaches an entire school on Chicago's South Side that we are all truly made in God's image. Sonari is a reporter for NPR News . (8 minutes)

Act Four
A man has a very clear vision of how he always stood up to his father,
protected his mother and fought hard for the truth. Until one day he
discovers actual raw data — secretly recorded conversations — that
threaten to change his picture of everything. Producer Nancy Updike tells
the story. (12 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

      <description>Stories of how people cope after brushes with death. Sometimes death comes as a disease. Sometimes it swims up and bites you. And sometimes it's a pen or pencil, sitting there, just waiting for you to ingest it.

Prologue
Ira talks to comedian Tig Notaro , who recently had a bunch of horrible things happen to her all in the course of 4 months. (3 minutes) _Tig Notaro_

Act One
In July, Tig was diagnosed with cancer. A week later she went on stage in Los Angeles and did a now-legendary set about her string of misfortunes. This is an excerpt of the full performance, which is available on the album LIVE . (13 minutes) _Tig Notaro_

Act Two
A teenage girl gets bitten by a shark, rushed to the doctor's office, stitched up, and told she'll be totally fine. Crisis averted, right? Not so much. Ira tells the story. (21 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
Jessica Benko tells the story of a woman named Cathy who was almost killed several times by a thought that she just couldn't get rid of. (15 1/2 minutes) _Jessica Benko_

Act Four
Tim Kreider almost died after he was stabbed in the throat. But that wasn't nearly as interesting as the year that followed. A version of this essay appears in Tim's most recent book, We Learn Nothing . (4 minutes) _Tim Kreider_

      <description>People breaking the rules fully, completely, and with no bad consequences. Some justify this by saying they’re doing it for others, or for a greater good. Some really don’t care. And, unlike the mealy weaklings you usually hear on this program: none of these wrongdoers seems regretful about what they’ve done.

Prologue
Ira takes a flight with travel writer Ken Hegan , to witness Ken deploying a travel gadget that keeps the seat in front of him from reclining. This means more knee space for Ken — but does he get away with it, really? (6 minutes)

Act One
A boy rides shotgun in a memorable car ride with his mother, and in the process learns how his father earns money for their family. This story appears in Domingo Martinez’s memoir, The Boy Kings of Texas , which was a finalist for the National Book Award. (17 min) _Domingo Martinez_

Act Two
We asked listeners to call in with their stories of getting away with it, and got nearly 1000 messages. Here are a handful. (6 minutes)

Act Three
Molly Shannon tells the story of when she and a friend evaded a whole lot of adults to travel half-way across the country, despite the fact that they were twelve years old and wearing tutus. Her story was recorded during a live taping of WTF with Marc Maron . (4 minutes) _Molly Shannon_

Act Four
Producer Alex Blumberg tells the story of how Oklahoma, against huge odds, came to have the first and best publicly-funded pre-school system in the country, and how one businessman joined the fight because a cardboard box full of evidence convinced him that pre-school was the smartest business decision the state could make. (21 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

      <description>Everyone knows that politics is now so divided in our country that not only do the two sides disagree on the solutions to the country’s problems, they don’t even agree on what the problems are. It’s two versions of the world in collision. This week we hear from people who’ve seen this infect their personal lives.

Prologue
Ira Glass rides around with a man in the man's hometown...a man who doesn't want us to say his name on the radio. Why? Because he's secretly a Democrat, in a small town dominated by Republicans. (5 1/2 minutes)

Act One
We surveyed hundreds of people around the country, from every part of the political spectrum, about the ways in which politics are interfering with their friendships and families. Producer Lisa Pollak reports. We collaborated with American Public Media’s Public Insight Network to find some of the interviewees for this story. Individual stories about how politics have affected personal relationships appear on their website . Lisa also spoke with Phil Neisser and Jacob Hess, two political opposites and authors of You're Not as Crazy as I Thought (But You're Still Wrong) , about their advice for how liberals and conservatives can have more productive conversations. (20 minutes) _Lisa Pollak_

Act Two
A portrait of what it looks like when politics gets polarized, and how hard it is for people in the middle to hang on. Producer Sarah Koenig explains what happened when a wave of Republican politicians swept to power with a three-to-one majority in 2010. New Hampshire’s a small state, and the shift to a more divisive in-your-face kind of politics happened very quickly, so it’s possible to see exactly what’s gained and lost when that happens. (30 1/2 minutes) Update 11/7/12: Our story ended with a question: Is this an aberration, or is this the new New Hampshire? Yesterday we got an answer — and it demonstrates how the state's huge House of Representatives is so very representative, so responsive to shifts in public mood. After giving Republicans a three-to-one majority in the House and Senate in 2010, voters have swung the other way. Here's what we know so far: Early numbers have the Democrats taking 217 seats to the Republicans' 177, with six seats still undetermined. Speaker Bill O'Brien won his House seat, but he won't be speaker again, because Republicans not only lost their majority, they lost the House entirely. Reporters in New Hampshire are saying that Bill O'Brien won't be seeking any leadership position at all. _Sarah Koenig_

      <description>Growing up in Mankato, Minnesota, John Biewen says, nobody ever talked about the most important historical event ever to happen there: in 1862, it was the site of the largest mass execution in U.S. history. Thirty-eight Dakota Indians were hanged after a war with white settlers. John went back to Minnesota to figure out what really happened 150 years ago, and why Minnesotans didn’t talk about it much after.

Prologue
Ira talks to John Biewen about how remarkable it is that he could grow up in a town and never learn about the most significant event in its history. This show about Native Americans and settlers was first broadcast on Thanksgiving weekend 2012, on the 150th anniversary of the war. John Biewen is director of the audio program at the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University. He hosts the podcast Scene on Radio . (4 minutes) _John Biewen_

Act One
John meets up with Gwen Westerman , a Dakota woman who moved to Mankato twenty years ago, also having no idea about its history. Together they travel to historic sites across Minnesota, reconstructing the story of what led to the war between the Dakota and the settlers. Gwen is a professor at Minnesota State University, Mankato, and co-author of the book Mni Sota Makoce: The Land of the Dakota . (25 minutes)

Act Two
John continues the story of the Dakota War of 1862, and how it resulted in the expulsion of the Dakota people from the state of Minnesota. Then John goes back to his hometown to see how this history is being taught today. He speaks with historian Mary Wingerd, author of North Country: The Making of Minnesota , about why so many people — including both of them — grew up in Minnesota and heard so little about the war. And he witnesses Dakota people, on the 150th anniversary of the war, crossing the state line and returning to Minnesota. (26 minutes)

      <description>What animals sacrifice for us, and what we sacrifice for them. Including a story from Susan Orlean about dogs in World War II, and theThis American Lifestaff confronts Ira about his dog, Piney.

Prologue
Ira admits there is a question he’s wanted to know the answer to since he was a kid in Hebrew school: Why is it that Jews don’t sacrifice animals anymore? Especially since the Old Testament is so clear that God wants it? Ira talks to religious studies scholar Jonathan Klawans to find out. Jonathan is the author of a book covering this subject, Purity, Sacrifice and the Temple . (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Susan Orlean tells us about the moment America asked untrained household canines to make the ultimate sacrifice: to serve in World War II. Susan talks to Gina Snyder, who remembers being a teenager when her dog Tommy joined the service. And Susan digs into the national archives to learn the fate of other dogs that fought on the front lines. A version of this story appears in Susan’s book Rin Tin Tin: The Life and the Legend . Videos: Watch this military dog use training video , and a War Department Film Bulletin, called " Use of War Dogs ." (No sound on that second one.) (20 minutes) _Susan Orlean_

Act Two
Camas Davis tells a true story about a rabbit kidnapping that saves some rabbits' lives, kills those same rabbits' babies, and leaves students in a Portland rabbit-butchering class scratching their heads. (11 minutes) _Camas Davis_

Act Three
Producer Nancy Updike reveals to Ira the staff’s concern about his dog, Piney. (17 minutes)

      <description>This week we take on ... this week. Stories united by one thing: They all happened in the seven days prior to broadcast. We try our hand reporting the global stories in Egypt and Afghanistan; and take on super local stories, too, like a man who tries valiantly — valiantly! — to actually get out of bed when his alarm clock goes off.

Prologue
A 17-year-old Ethiopian girl who is just learning English goes with her teacher to face her fears head-on: She orders tea in a local coffee shop. A woman in America talks to Ira about her husband, in Syria, who is currently negotiating with kidnappers for the release of two of his employees. In Doha, Qatar, the lead negotiator for the Philippines at the United Nations Climate Change Conference implores world governments to take action now. The Missoula Community Theater puts on a special performance of their Christmas musical, adapted to an audience of people on the autism spectrum. A group of 10 year-old girls in Charlottesville, Virginia, talk smack while competing in a local step competition. And a man on the Airtrain at Newark Airport gets ready to meet his newly-discovered half-brother. (11 minutes)

Act Two
Lisa Pollak goes to the Enchanted Snowfall at La Encantada Mall , where the snow is "98 percent magic; 2 percent soap." (4 minutes) _Lisa Pollak_

Act Three
Ira asks Washington-insider Norman Ornstein if we actually need to be paying attention to all of the Fiscal Cliff political news. Or can it wait until next week? Ornstein is the author of the book It's Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American Constitutional System Collided With the New Politics of Extremism . (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Four
A group called NO/AIDS heads into bars to offer free HIV testing for high-risk people. Writer Nathaniel Rich tells the story of one man's test. Nathaniel is the author of the forthcoming book Odds Against Tomorrow . (6 minutes)

Act Five
It's been a tumultuous week of protests and demonstrations in Egypt.  Nancy
Updike talks to two Egyptian men whose ideologies are completely opposite,
except one thing unites them: Their anger at the United States. (6 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Six
We hear from the people in the land of the non-working: Fred Beaton on his
last shift driving a shuttle bus at Logan Airport before he retires; Linc
Cohen and Sandi Weisenberg talk about what chores get done once retirement
begins; and Angela Jane Evancie tries to get her boyfriend, Morgan Peach, to
stop relaxing quite so much. (5 minutes)

      <description>This holiday season, we bring you a show filled with stories of people going to great lengths to throw a special Christmas for their families, including: tales of Luna the guinea pig, Bambi the reindeer, and Jeko the super-powerful (and somewhat-scary) Christmas elf.

Prologue
Linda Lutton and her eleven year old daughter Pirecua explain what happened the year Pirecua begged for a gift that she turned out to be allergic to. Linda is a reporter at our home station, WBEZ Chicago. (6 minutes)

Act One
Maya Gurantz tells the story of Glenn and Laurie Mutchler, who go further than most parents to create a magical Christmas for their kids, Colin, Erica and Adam. Theirs included a family mythology of Santas that had its own logic, with many Santas and a family elf named Jeko, who were never jolly and often thrillingly scary. (20 minutes)

Act Two
Ira talks with Connie Rex about the deer she and her sisters kidnapped and ended up putting into their school’s Christmas pageant in Woodruff, Utah, in a starring role. (11 minutes)

Act Three
Ron Carlson reads from a short story — it’s fiction — about a man, his wife Drew, his daughter Elise, a Christmas sledding record, a tree, and horse manure. "The H Street Sledding Record" by Ron Carlson. Copyright © 1984 by Ron Carlson. From his story collection A KIND OF FLYING : Selected Stories by Ron Carlson, published by W. W. Norton & Co.

      <description>A perfectly normal guy gets rid of everything he owns, changes his name, says goodbye to his friends — and begins walking. In the name of peace. And Honduran government officials try to heal their corrupt country by starting a perfect city, from scratch. For the new year, we bring you stories about how far some people go in hopes of a better life.

Prologue
Julia Lurie is an American teaching English at an all-girls high school in Gwangju, a city in South 
Korea. When she first got there, some things struck her as strange: On every floor of the school there was a full-length mirror, as well as a scale. And the girls used them constantly. They seemed openly preoccupied by their looks and their weight. South Korea, she finds out, has the highest per capita rate of plastic surgery in the world — some of her students had already had plastic surgery, and more were planning to get it. Julia tells what happened when she decided to teach a lesson on "beauty" to her students. (8 minutes)

Act One
Elna Baker tells a story about her friend Daryl Watson . Daryl was a talented playwright working in New York City. In 2009, Elna got a mass-email from him explaining how he was going to walk across the country in the name of peace. And that he was changing his name to "Peace Pilgrim." He plans to spend six months walking, in hopes that he'll figure out his purpose in life. He gives away everything he owns and all his money, and sets off from Delaware. He lasts three days. Elna never knew what had happened, so recently she met up with Daryl and got him to tell the story. Elna is the author of a memoir, The New York Regional Mormon Singles Halloween Dance . Daryl's newest play is "Unbound." In February there will be a reading of Daryl's newest play, "Unbound," at the IAMA Theatre Company in Los Angeles. (21 minutes) _Elna Baker_

Act Two
A young idealist named Octavio Sanchez is chief of staff to the president of Honduras. He gets an idea: What if you could cure all your country's ills by just ... starting over? In one little spot, you could create a whole new, perfect city. Do all the reforms you want to do in that one place — and if it works, it could spread to the whole country. But how could he pull off such a radical project? Then Octavio sees a TED Talk by a famous American economist, Paul Romer. Romer has more or less the same idea: poor countries could invite richer countries to found and run ideal "charter cities." It's not colonialism, Romer explains, because the poor countries are asking for help. Octavio and Paul get together and persuade the Honduran president. They're off and running. They choose a spot, they change the constitution to make it legal, they start searching for investors. But then, the whole thing starts to sour — for reasons both inevitable, and surprising. Chana Joffe-Walt and Jacob Goldstein of our Planet Money team went to Honduras to find out how it all went down. (28 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt, Planet Money_

      <description>We got a tip about a meat plant selling pig intestines as fake calamari, wondered if it could be true, and decided to investigate. Doppelgängers, doubles, evil twins and not-so-evil twins, this week. Fred Armisen co-hosts with Ira Glass.

Prologue
Fred Armisen worked up an imitation of Ira and put it into a sketch on Saturday Night Live a couple of years ago. But when they rehearsed it with an audience, there was not a roar of recognition; it seemed like Ira might not be famous enough to be mocked on network TV. Armisen finally gets a go as Ira’s doppelgänger in our studios by co-hosting this episode. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Ben Calhoun tells a story of physical resemblance — not of a person, but of food. A while ago, a farmer walked through a pork processing plant in Oklahoma with a friend who managed it. He came across boxes stacked on the floor with labels that said "artificial calamari." So he asked his friend "What’s artificial calamari?" "Bung," his friend replied. "Hog rectum." Have you or I eaten bung dressed up as seafood? Ben investigated. Extra: Pig/squid shirts and prints . (26 minutes) _Ben Calhoun_

Act Two
For decades, the writer Alex Kotlowitz has been writing about the inner cities and the toll of violence on young people. So when he heard about a program at Drexel University where guys from the inner city get counseling for PTSD, he wondered if the effect of urban violence was comparable to the trauma that a person experiences from war. Kotlowitz talks to a military vet from Afghanistan and a guy from Philadelphia who’s lived in some pretty bad neighborhoods to find out if they are doubles of some sort. Alex is the author of the book There Are No Children Here and producer of the documentary film The Interrupters . Special thanks to the program Healing Hurt People at Drexel University for assistance with this story. (23 minutes) _Alex Kotlowitz_

      <description>This week we look at people who see themselves in others and try to live out their lives through stand-ins — including the story of what one father saw in the convicted murderer he decided to adopt. And the proxy battle over a woman’s honor that became a presidential obsession.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass visits Claremont Middle School in Oakland, CA — a school with two principals. Principals Reggie and Ronnie Richardson are also twins. Sharing the job provides all kinds of advantages ... primarily, they can stand in for each other when the other is not around. (10 mins.) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Producer Sarah Koenig talks with historian Nancy Tomes about a presidential scandal known as The Petticoat Affair. It involved Andrew Jackson and the honor of a woman who he didn't sleep with. A woman who reminded him of his deceased wife. (19 minutes) _Sarah Koenig_

Act Two
Amity Bitzel was a teenager when her parents decided to adopt a 27-year-old man. And that wasn't the strange part. The man they adopted was an ex-con who had killed his previous adoptive parents. Amity tells the story of this time in her life, and producer Brian Reed speaks with Amity's father to find out why he decided to call the man his son. Amity published a version of this story on XOJane. (26 minutes)

      <description>Love makes us do crazy things. But usually not this crazy. This week for Valentine's Day we have stories of people going to extremes to find and pursue their one true love.

Prologue
David Kestenbaum tells Ira about the time, when he was doing graduate work in physics, he and his other single friends decided to figure out the mathematical probability that they’d find girlfriends. They wanted to know what the chances were that there was more than one person in the world for them. When you’re in love, it always feels like it was meant to be, whether or not it really, statistically speaking, is. (6 1/2 minutes) _David Kestenbaum_

Act One
Kurt Braunohler and his girlfriend had been together for thirteen years, and they were only 30. They wondered why they had never considered marriage, and realized that they needed to sleep with other people before they tied the knot. Then the adventure began. Kurt acts on the TV show Black Monday and is on a standup tour. (18 1/2 minutes) _Kurt Braunohler_

Act Two
At three high schools in Palm Beach County, Florida, several young police officers were sent undercover to pose as students, tasked with making drug arrests. And this, this is the setting for a love story, reported by Robbie Brown. In 2014, Lin-Manuel Miranda turned this story into a 14-minute Broadway mini-musical for our live show at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. You can watch the  performance and hear the original cast album . (13 minutes) _Robbie Brown_

Act Three
Ben Loory wrote and tells this story, which begins with a duck falling in love with a rock. (8 minutes) _Ben Loory_

Act Four
A live performance detailing a humiliating love affair. When comedian Mike Birbiglia was in high school, he fell for a cool girl named Amanda. They start going out, and it’s going great, except that Amanda hasn't quite broken up with Scott, her other boyfriend. So for instance when Mike goes to Amanda’s house to meet her parents, Scott's there too, and Amanda takes turns making out with each of them while the other's in the bathroom. It only gets worse. (9 minutes) _Mike Birbiglia_

      <description>We spent five months at Harper High School in Chicago, where last year alone 29 current and recent students were shot. 29. We went to get a sense of what it means to live in the midst of all this gun violence, how teens and adults navigate a world of funerals and Homecoming dances. We found so many incredible and surprising stories,this show is a two-parter.

Prologue
At the first day assembly, the freshman seem confused and nervous while the seniors are boisterous and confident. It's exactly the kind of first day stuff you'd expect at any school. Until Harper Principal Leonetta Sanders calls for a moment of silence to honor the students Harper has lost in the last year. Then Harper doesn't seem so ordinary. In the clean and orderly halls of Harper, we meet the staff as they shepherd the students through new schedules and rules while they also try to reassure parents about the frightening rise in shootings in the neighborhood. (7 minutes)

Act One
So many of the shootings in the Englewood neighborhood of Chicago, the neighborhood where Harper High sits, are characterized as "gang-related." Often, the implication is that gang-related means there is a reason to the shooting — huge, established gangs shooting it out over drug territory. Gang-related often implies you must've deserved it, a certain level of 'what goes around comes around.' Reporter Linda Lutton talks to dozens of Harper students who say adults don't understand that that's not the way it works. Gangs don't operate the way they used to. (13 minutes) _Linda Lutton_

Act Two
Reporter Alex Kotlowitz spends time in the social work office, where the effects of gun violence are most often apparent. Early on in the year, social worker Crystal Smith spends time with a junior named Devonte, talking him through his grief and guilt after Devonte accidentally shot and killed his 14 year old brother last year. Crystal also meets with Devonte's mother, who has some understandably confused feelings towards Devonte. (16 minutes) _Alex Kotlowitz_

Act Three
By early October, it's been pretty quiet at Harper, as far as gun violence goes. But on the day before the homecoming game, during a pep rally, a senior named Damoni who is both on the football team and nominated for Homecoming King, gets word that a good friend of his, James, has been shot. James is also a former Harper student with many ties to the school. Reporter Ben Calhoun follows Principal Sanders and the rest of the Harper staff as they jump into action and try to ward off more violence, keep the students safe and grapple with whether they need to cancel the Harper High School Homecoming. Theme music for our two-part series on Harper High School was composed by The Latebloomer. Hear the original . Update 4/2013: First Lady Michelle Obama to visit Harper High School Update 7/2013: Harper Student Murdered (18 minutes) _Ben Calhoun_

      <description>We pick up where we left offlast weekin our second hour from Harper High School in Chicago. We find out if a shooting in the neighborhood will derail the school's Homecoming game and dance. We hear the origin story of one of Harper's gangs. And we ask a group of teenagers: where do you get your guns?

Prologue
Principal Leonetta Sanders is worried that in the wake of a recent shooting, some of her students at Harper might be in danger of retaliatory violence. The threat is so real, she's considering canceling the school's Homecoming football game and dance. The possibility of canceling is heartbreaking to her, though, as all she wants is to give her students one normal high school dance. On Homecoming day, she gathers her staff to announce that there has been word of more shooting in the neighborhood. (5 minutes)

Act One
Most murders in Chicago happen in public places — parks, alleyways, cars. Scores of Harper students will tell you they've actually seen someone shot. Reporter Alex Kotlowitz talks with a junior named Thomas, who has seen more than his fair share. Thomas meets with his social worker, Anita Stewart, and tries to explain what it feels like to hold all of these images — and feelings — inside of him. He worries he can't hold on to them much longer. (10 minutes) _Alex Kotlowitz_

Act Two
Reporter Ben Calhoun tells the story of Terrance Green, a 16-year-old who was killed three years ago but is still an iconic presence at Harper.  Ben asks Terrance's dad and his best friend: Why did this one kid's death lead to slickly produced songs, tribute videos, a gang in his name, assault rifles on the street and an entire remapping of the violence in the area around Harper High School? (15 minutes) _Ben Calhoun_

Act Three
Chicago has strict gun laws but, obviously, teenagers are somehow getting their hands on guns. Lots of guns. We've all heard about straw purchasers and gun shows but 15-year-olds aren't spending hundreds of dollars to buy guns, or exploiting gun show loopholes. Reporter Linda Lutton gathers together a group of Harper boys and asks them: where do you get your guns? They tell her not only where they get them, but where they keep them, too. (6 minutes) _Linda Lutton_

Act Four
In the first hour of our Harper High School shows, Alex Kotlowitz talked to a junior named Devonte who a year earlier had accidentally shot and killed his 14-year-old brother. Devonte was forming a strong relationship with Crystal Smith, one of the social workers, and beginning to come to terms with both his grief and guilt. Alex checks back in with Devonte and finds out that his life has taken some troubling turns. (8 minutes) _Alex Kotlowitz_

Act Five
Late in the semester, Principal Sanders takes a look at her budget. It doesn't look good. She talks with Ben Calhoun about what is going to change — and who won't be at Harper — next year. Update 4/2013: First Lady Michelle Obama to visit Harper High School Update 7/2013: Harper Student Murdered (7 minutes) _Ben Calhoun_

Act Six
Harper High School isn't alone. Original music in this episode by The Latebloomer . (3 minutes)

      <description>We asked listeners to send us their best coincidence stories, and we got more than 1,300 submissions! There were so many good ones we decided to make a whole show about them. From a chance encounter at a bus station to a romantic dollar bill to a baffling apparition in a college shower stall.

Prologue
Hannah Jacoby tells the story of when she and her best friend Lindsey bonded over those toy soldiers with the parachutes, called (really) Poopatroopers — and how the little jumpers perfectly bookended their high-school years. And guest host Sarah Koenig explains the very interesting trends we discovered in our listeners' coincidences. (9 minutes) _Sarah Koenig_

Act One
A surprising number of coincidences involve grandmothers — that’s one of the things we learned doing this show. One grandma has so many coincidences happen to her, it drives her granddaughter, 16-year-old Juliana Bontrager, to try to beat her at her own coincidence game. And we also hear from Blake Oliver about a very strange appearance his grandma once made. You can hear more from Blake Oliver in an interview on The Story . (9 minutes)

Act Two
When it comes to love, coincidences tend to loom extra-large. Stephen Lee tells about the time his parents first met his fiance’s parents, and his future mother-in-law dropped a coincidence bomb. And we hear how a dollar bill ended up clinching a marriage, after floating around Chicago for years. (10 minutes)

Act Three
Ryan Rozar told us about a confounding coincidence that was visited on him in college. We didn’t think it was a coincidence at all, so we set out to prove him wrong. (8 minutes)

Act Four
More stories of dazzling coincidences: an old boyfriend is conjured in Morocco, a jazz singer seems to rise from the dead, and three boys believe they’ve seen a corpse. Plus stories of errant fathers, lost and found. (13 minutes)

Act Five
Sometimes the best way to appreciate a coincidence is to look past all the rational reasons it might have happened. Other times, it’s better to face facts — even very, very large facts. Kerry Weeks tells about the time he lost a pocketknife, and turned to the galaxy for help. His story was recorded live at a Moth StorySLAM in New York City. (7 minutes)

      <description>The number of Americans receiving federal disability payments has nearly doubled over the last 15 years. There are towns and counties around the nation where almost 1/4 of adults are on disability.Planet Money's Chana Joffe-Walt spent 6 months exploring the disability program, and emerges with a story of the U.S. economy quite different than the one we've been hearing.

Prologue
Ira Glass talks with Planet Money reporter, Chana Joffe-Walt, about Hale County, Alabama — a place where one fourth of working age adults are on disability. That means the government has determined that due to a health issue, 25 percent of the adults in Hale County are unable to work, qualifying them for monthly payments and health care coverage. Chana explains that people in Hale County have a lot of theories as to why their disability numbers are so high: freeloaders, cheaters, hard partiers, obesity. But none of those seem quite right. The rise in disability isn't just happening in Hale County but in pockets all over the country. 14 million people are now receiving disability payments. And it's a number that is growing. We devote the whole show today to figuring out why these numbers are ballooning and what it says about our economy. (7 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt_

Act One
Chana Joffe-Walt spent six months reporting on the rise in people on disability. She spends time in Hale County, Alabama, talking to the only general practitioner in town, the main person who okays so many of the county's residents for disability. In addition to giving each patient a medical exam, the doctor also asks this question: what grade did you finish? Chana explains why that one question is so central to the whole story. (22 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt_

Act Two
Chana Joffe-Walt continues her story about the phenomenal rise in disability payments over the last 30 years, since President Bill Clinton signed legislation pledging to "end welfare as we know it." Turns out, two private sector groups have really contributed to the growing disability roles. One is a group of people you'd probably expect, the other is a shock. And Chana looks at one of the fastest growing populations on disability: kids. (26 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt_

      <description>A Native American tribe is doing exactly the opposite of what you'd think they'd do: they're kicking people out of the tribe, huge numbers of them, including people whose ancestors without question were part of the tribe. And the story of a white guy who only wants to date Asian women, who then has to adjust to the reality of a real actual Asian woman in his life. The phrase "finding your tribe" is a total cliche — but one that does apply to certain situations.

Prologue
Until almost 10,000 years ago, everyone literally lived in a tribe of a few hundred or a small band of a few dozen people. U.C.L.A. scientist Jared Diamond talks about how back then, you could go your whole life without ever encountering a stranger. He recently came out with a book called The World Until Yesterday . (7 minutes)

Act One
There is a Native American tribe in California called the Chukchansi that’s fighting over the most basic thing any group can fight over — who should be a member? David Ferry explains just how bitter their dispute has become. (22 minutes)

Act Two
How could whispering change your life? Andrea Seigel tells this story about finding out that she is undeniably not alone. She’s a novelist with several books including Like the Red Panda . (14 minutes)

Act Three
A story about a guy named Steven who wants in on a group he definitely was not born into — and seems very unlikely to be accepted by. Filmmaker Debbie Lum tells the story, which is excerpted from her documentary Seeking Asian Female . A version of this story originally ran on the radio program Snap Judgment . Companion video series about dating and race here . (13 minutes)

      <description>After years of being stuck, the national conversation on climate change finally started to shift — just a little — last year, the hottest year on record in the U.S., with Hurricane Sandy flooding the New York subway, drought devastating Midwest farms, and California and Colorado on fire. Lots of people were wondering if global warming had finally arrived, here at home. This week, stories about this new reality.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass remembers Hurricane Sandy, and the feeling that we might be getting a preview of 
what the world would looking like as climate change continues. He talks about how stuck the 
country’s conversation about climate change has been, but how for the first time in a long time, it 
seems that might change. (2 minutes)

Act One
Reporter Julia Kumari Drapkin tells the story of Colorado’s State Climatologist, Nolan Doesken . Doesken has long believed that humans are driving climate change, but never connected it to his own life. Even after several years of some of the most devastating weather his state has ever seen, Nolan considered climate change a worry for the future. Then, last year, he watched as his state experienced some of the most extreme weather it ever has. For the first time, Nolan felt like he was looking at what the future would be like where he lives. He felt scared. Julia tells the story of how this has all changed Nolan, and changed what he’s saying to the people of his home state. Julia is the lead producer of iSeeChange at station KVNF, funded by Localore , AIR and CPB . (18 minutes)

Act Two
Producer Ben Calhoun tells the story of a former Congressional Representative from South Carolina, Bob Inglis . Inglis is a conservative Republican who once doubted climate science. After he looked at the research, he changed his mind, and decided to speak out. In 2010, he was mocked by people in his own party and trounced in by a Tea Party-backed candidate. Since then, Bob has dedicated himself to the issue even more — and he’s now trying to create a conservative coalition for climate change action. (15 minutes)

Act Three
Host Ira Glass tells the story of writer turned activist Bill McKibben . McKibben is trying to reinvent progressive politics when it come to climate change. He’s attempting to create a divestment campaign modeled after the successful campaign against apartheid in South Africa. The campaign is designed recast the discussion of climate change with fossil fuel companies as the villains. (18 minutes)

      <description>Two years ago, we dida programabout a mysterious business in Texas that threatens companies with lawsuits for violating its patents. But the world of patent lawsuits is so secretive, there were basic questions we could not answer. Now we can. And we get a glimpse why people say our patent system may be discouraging, not encouraging, innovation.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass and Zoe Chace from NPR’s Planet Money talk with Jim Logan and Richard Baker of Personal Audio , which claims it holds a patent used by all podcasters. Podcasters, they say, owe them money. Only catch: their company never made a digital podcast or invented a way to download it into a listening device. What they did, back in 1996: they patented the idea that such a thing can be done. Now they’ve asked podcasters to pay them licensing fees ... including Adam Carolla , Stuff You Should Know , Jesse Thorn and Marc Maron , who we hear from. Although Personal Audio says they aren’t asking for licenses from non-profits or public radio at this time, Maron’s and Thorn’s podcasts appear on public radio. (7 minutes) _Planet Money_

Act One
NPR reporter Laura Sydell and This American Life producer/ Planet Money co-host Alex Blumberg tell the story of Intellectual Ventures , which is accused of being the largest of the patent trolls. Executives at Intellectual Ventures insist they are not trolls, but rather, promoters of innovation. They buy patents from struggling inventors, which encourages those inventors to go out and invent more stuff. Intellectual Ventures offers an example of such an inventor, a man named Chris Crawford. But when Laura and Alex try and talk to Chris Crawford, it leads them on a long search, culminating in a small town in Texas, where they find a hallway full of seemingly empty offices with no employees. (25 minutes) _Alex Blumberg, Planet Money, Laura Sydell_

      <description>This week we return to one of our favorite themes: This Week! All of the stories in the show are things that have taken place in the last seven days. We've got our own take on the big, national stories of the week but we also turn a searchlight across America and find the smaller, more personal and more spectacular stories that most of us never hear.

Prologue
Third and fourth graders from Polaris Charter Academy in Chicago get ready for an overnight camping trip. Before they set off, they review the rules: What to do if you see a bug; what to do if you have to go to the bathroom; and most important — what to do if you’re confronted with a crying friend. In Berwick, Pennsylvania, we drop in a town meeting, where Detective Greg Martin tells residents the tricks to spotting kids who might be cooking meth in their neighborhoods. Next to central California, where a juvenile prisoner named Jorge gets transferred to an adult prison, the very day he turns 18. And in St. Paul, Minnesota, real estate agent Sophia Thu Pham goes door to door, hoping people are game to sell their houses. (7 minutes)

Act One
News kept coming all week about the National Security Agency collecting data on the phone numbers we dial. Government officials are saying there’s nothing to be alarmed about. But it’s hard to know whether we should be alarmed anyway — since most of us don’t know what it feels like to have the government eavesdropping on our phone calls and emails. To find out, Ira talks to four attorneys for Guantanamo detainees, who know for sure they’re being spied on: Candace Gorman, David Nevin, Ramzi Kassem, and David Raimes. (8 minutes)

Act Two
Reporter Annie Correal hangs around with Sol Saltzman, a demolition guy who’s scrambling for bids around Oklahoma City, to help clean up damage from the recent tornados. It’s a cutthroat business, and Sol explains to Annie how he works all the angles. Annie’s reporting is part of series she’s doing on disaster migrants, with support from the French-American Foundation Immigration Journalism Fellowship . (8 minutes) _Annie Correal_

Act Three
Peter Lee had his arm amputated because of cancer three years ago. On Thursday of this week, he got a new, top-of-the-line prosthetic arm. During his final fitting, he talks to Rio Bennin, who also has a prosthetic arm — but Rio’s is an older model, not as nearly as fancy as Peter’s. (3 1/2 minutes)

Act Four
At Guantanamo Bay, hearings resumed for Abd al Rahim al Nashiri, who is accused of organizing the attack on the USS Cole, in 2000. This week was the first time reporters had been back to Guantanamo since President Obama gave a speech in which he said he’d renew efforts to close the prison. Meanwhile, a majority of the prisoners at Guantanamo are now on a hunger strike, and dozens of them are being force-fed. This American Life producer Sarah Koenig talks to reporter John Knefel about what it was like to be there. John reports on Guantanamo for rollingstone.com , and is co-host of the Internet radio show Radio Dispatch . (10 1/2 minutes) _Sarah Koenig_

Act Five
Science teacher Jason Pittman , who teaches pre-school through sixth grade at a school in Fairfax County, Virginia, won a big teaching award this week. In fact, during his ten years teaching, he’s won many, many awards. He loves his job. But this week, he explains to Ira why he’s quitting, even though he doesn’t want to. (6 minutes)

Act Six
On Wednesday, Florida executed a death row inmate named William Van Poyck . His execution came the same week that Florida’s governor signed a new law designed to speed up executions in the state. Emily Bazelon , legal affairs editor at Slate , explains that of all the states in the country, Florida is probably the last one where you’d want executions to move faster. (8 minutes) _Emily Bazelon_

Act Seven
MaryEllen Bowman tells Ira about celebrating her 22-year-old daughter Rachel Hala’s baby shower this week. A year ago, she says, she was planning her daughter’s funeral instead. (3 1/2 minutes)

      <description>This week, stories about people who know something's a bad idea, but convince themselves to do that thing anyway. Including the story of a bunch of illegal immigrants who turn themselves in to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, hoping to be sent into detention.

Prologue
Ira plays audio from a YouTube video made by Jonathan Perez. In it, 24 year old Jonathan, 
an undocumented immigrant, walks straight into a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
office, tells an officer he doesn’t have papers, and gets himself arrested. Why would anyone do 
that? (8 minutes)

Act One
Reporter Michael May tells the story of activists from the National Immigrant Youth Alliance who intentionally got arrested for being undocumented. They believed if they could get inside the Broward Transitional Center in Florida, they could prevent lots of the immigrants there from being deported. Obama Administration policy, laid out in a series of documents called the Morton memos, states that non-violent immigrants who are not criminals are low priority for detention. Michael May also wrote a print version of this story, for The American Prospect . (27 minutes) _Michael May_

Act Two
Christine Gentry grew up in a house in Texas where there was one important rule above all others. It came from her dad: we have loaded guns in the house, and even though I’ve taught you how to shoot them, no one can ever touch them without me being there. As far as anyone in the family knew the kids grew up obeying that rule. Until this past December when Christine confesses to the one time when — as a teenager — that she broke the rule. (10 minutes)

Act Three
Ben Loory reads his short story about an unlikely friendship that forms between a moose and a man. It's from his fiction collection Stories for the Nighttime and Some for the Day . (8 minutes) _Ben Loory_

      <description>The truly incredible story of a guy named Kirk Johnson who started a list of hundreds of Iraqis who needed to get out of their country. They were getting death threats, and he was their only hope. Only 26 and living in his aunt's basement, he had no idea what to do. How Kirk kind of succeeded spectacularly and failed spectacularly at the same time.

Prologue
Ira talks with Producer Nancy Updike about when she first met Kirk Johnson in 2007. At the time 
he was mulling a crazy plan that involved Iraqi refugees, the Coast Guard and a boat. (5 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act One
Kirk sleepwalks through an open window and into a completely different life. He explains how he starts compiling a list of Iraqis who’d worked with the U.S. government after the invasion, whose lives were now in danger because of that. Carrying around that list gets some very strange reactions from government officials. Kirk is founder and executive director of The List Project to Resettle Iraqi Allies . His memoir To Be a Friend Is Fatal comes out in September. (23 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Two
To get a sense of what may be broken about our process for bringing these Iraqis into the US, the ones who worked with US forces and who believe their lives are now in danger because of that, Kirk Johnson tells Nancy Updike about one guy. Almost a year of his emails were forwarded to Kirk, who printed them out and started to realize that he was looking at a dead man’s attempt to immigrate to the U.S. (29 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

      <description>To celebrate our 500th episode, Ira asked the producers ofThis American Lifeto talk about their very favorite moments on the show. Some chose stories that've been more or less forgotten for years; others chose just one line of script, or a segment that secretly made them cry. So for our 500th, we bring you the best ofThis American Life— the way we've been hearing it, behind the scenes, all these years.

Prologue
Ira Glass talks with Senior Producer Julie Snyder about how it feels to get to the 500th episode.  And he explains what we're doing on today's show: the producers of the program are picking their favorite moments from the previous 499 shows, which tend to be very different sorts of moments than listeners choose. (2 minutes) _Julie Snyder_

Act One
Julie Snyder talks about a favorite passage from Sarah Vowell's story in episode 107: Trail of Tears . Then she talks about Alex Blumberg's interview with Griffin Hansbury in episode 220: Testosterone . Robyn Semien talks about Ira's interview with Denise Moore, who was trapped in the New Orleans Convention Center after Hurricane Katrina. That interview was in episode 296: After the Flood . Nancy Updike picked John Hodgman's story about trying to write a screenplay for a movie that already existed, from episode 232: The Real Story . Then Sarah Koenig talks about Nancy's writing in episode 266: I’m from the Private Sector and I’m Here to Help , about military contractors in Iraq. Sarah also talks about Josh Bearman's story about his mom and brother, from episode 334: Duty Calls . And about Ira's interview with Tami Sagher in episode 314: It’s Never Over . (29 minutes) _Josh Bearman, Sarah Koenig, Robyn Semien, Julie Snyder, Nancy Updike_

Act Two
Several producers talked about the first stories they ever heard on the show, before they worked here. Former producer Jonathan Goldstein, now host of WireTap , remembers the prologue to episode 27: The Cruelty of Children . Then producer Brian Reed talks about the first time he heard the show, when Ira spoke at his college and played a story by Jack Hitt from episode 188: Kid Logic . Alex Blumberg talks about an early story by Adam Davidson, Alex's current colleague at Planet Money , from episode 94: How To . The story is about Adam trying to figure out how much his life would be worth, if he died in an accident. At the end of the show, Ira talks about his own favorite episodes. Some of his favorites are also listener favorites, like Notes on Camp , Somewhere In The Arabian Sea , Harper High School Parts One and Two , Switched at Birth , Dr. Gilmer and Mr. Hyde , Starlee Kine's story from Break-Up , The Giant Pool of Money , and the episode about Harold Washington . But a lot of Ira's favorites are shows he likes for admittedly selfish reasons, when the experience of making the story just meant a lot to him — like the episode we did about David Rakoff after David died, the episode where Ira hung out in Paris with David Sedaris , the one where we tried to recreate the original recipe for Coca-Cola , or when Ira got to go to a Medieval Times restaurant with a noted medieval scholar , or talk with lots and lots of people in Georgia about a small town judge who had been accused of wrongdoing and eventually stepped down. Surprisingly, in the early years the show also helped Ira bond with his mom and dad , who had been skeptical about his choice to go into public radio. Our 500th episode ends with Julie Snyder talking about the only story that still makes her cry, no matter how many times she hears it, from episode 241: 20 Acts in 60 Minutes : (27 minutes) _Alex Blumberg, Adam Davidson, Jack Hitt, Brian Reed_

      <description>It's so easy to lose perspective (or worry you've lost perspective) when you're deep inside some situation. For instance, an American woman who suddenly trades her life for one in a place most people might think twice about: Juarez, Mexico.

Prologue
An open letter — supposedly from the foreign media covering Nelson Mandela — to every man woman and child in South Africa. (Thanks to John Matisonn for sending it — it was written by journalist Richard Poplak .) (3 ½ minutes)

Act One
A recording of a very unusual conversation that came about in an unusual way. Filmmaker named Eugene Jarecki made a documentary about the drug war, prisons and the criminal justice system called The House I Live In . He’s been taking it around the country and showing it in prisons, and producer Brian Reed went to one of these screenings where an inmate and a corrections staff member ended up talking face-to-face. (17 ½ minutes)

Act Two
Emily Bonderer Cruz is American. Her husband is Mexican. The only way he can ever live with her in the U.S. is to first live outside the U.S. for 10 years. So they moved to Mexico, to a town on the border across from El Paso, a town that was the murder capital of the world when they arrived. Emily writes about her life there on the really great blog "The Real Housewife of Ciudad Juarez." You can read some of her favorite posts here: “ 20% ,” “ Secondary Inspection ,” “ Sexico ,” “ Too Sad for Witty Titles ,” and “ How to Deal .” This story was produced by Ann Heppermann with assistance from Debbie Nathan. (22 ½ minutes) _Ann Heppermann_

Act Three
In Israel, Sayed Kashua, writes a weekly newspaper column that are these very frank, entertaining conversations about his day-to-day life. A few years ago, he moved his family from East Jerusalem (where most of the Arabs in the city live) to West Jerusalem (where it’s almost all Jews, not Arabs) and that kind of blew people’s minds, his included. We hear from some of his columns, which are read by actor Ramsey Faragallah. Kashua’s latest novel is called Second Person Singular . (12 minutes)

      <description>A journalist named Meron Estefanos gets a disturbing tip. She's given a phone number that supposedly belongs to a group of refugees being held hostage in the Sinai desert. She dials the number, and soon dozens of strangers are begging her to rescue them. How can she ignore them?

Prologue
Ira tells the story of Meron Estefanos , a freelance journalist who in 2011 got a troubling tip: A group of Eritrean hostages was being tortured and held for ransom in the Sinai desert. Along with the tip was a phone number. Meron dialed it, and soon dozens of desperate hostages were begging her for help. Their pleas were impossible for Meron to ignore: Soon she was talking to the hostages regularly and devoting her life to trying to save them. Today’s show includes excerpts from the harrowing phone calls she recorded with the hostages. (7 1/2 minutes)

Act One
Reporter Yowei Shaw tells the story of the first group of 28 captives that Meron spoke to, the obstacles she faced in trying to publicize their plight and her decision to try to raise ransom money to free them. (21 minutes)

Act Two
Yowei’s story continues. Meron learns whether or not the kidnappers can be trusted to keep their word when she pays the ransom, and what will become of the hostages. (26 minutes)

      <description>Stories of people doing the noble thing and stepping up to help, only to find out that others think what they're doing isn't helping at all.Planet Moneylooks at a charity that's decided to just give people money, and a sheriff in California devises a plan to let farmers grow weed — as long as they register with him.

Prologue
Ira speaks with Sharon Snyder. Until recently, Sharon was a clerk for circuit court judge in Missouri. While she was at work, a man and a woman approached her looking for some paperwork so they could help out their brother, who was in prison for rape. The prisoner claimed he was innocent of the crime and had decided to file a motion for a DNA test. Sharon decided to help the man with the paperwork, which didn't please her employer. (6 minutes)

Act One
Planet Money reporters David Kestenbaum and Jacob Goldstein went to Kenya to see the work of a charity called GiveDirectly in action. Instead of funding schools or wells or livestock, GiveDirectly has decided to just give money directly to the poor people who need it, and let them decide how to spend it. David and Jacob explain whether this method of charity works, and why some people think it's a terrible idea. (28 minutes) _Jacob Goldstein, David Kestenbaum, Planet Money_

Act Two
Under California law, it's legal to grow marijuana for medicinal purposes if you have a doctor's recommendation. A few years ago, Mendocino County Sheriff Tom Allman was trying to find a way to deal with the proliferation of marijuana in his county. Allman wanted to spend less time dealing with growers who were growing small, legal amounts, so he could focus on other problems — including criminals who run massive marijuana farms in the Mendocino National Forest. So he came up with a plan to allow the small farmers to grow, if they registered with his office. Growers would pay for little zip-ties they could put around the base of their marijuana plants, and the cops would know to leave them alone. It saved time and generated revenue. Reporter Mary Cuddehe tells the story of how the county and the nation responded to the sheriff's plan. (18 minutes) _Mary Cuddehe_

An admissions officer tells us the most wrongheaded things applicants try. And Michael Lewis has the incredible story of how a stolen library book got one man — Emir Kamenica — into his dream school.

Prologue
Students all over are starting college this month, and some of them still have a nagging question: what, exactly, got me in? An admissions officer talks about the most wrongheaded things applicants try. And Michael Lewis has the incredible story of how a stolen library book got one man into his dream school. (2 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Ira talks to Rick Clark, director of undergraduate admissions at the Georgia Institute of Technology, better known as Georgia Tech. Clark says the latest trend in misguided college admissions efforts: parents emailing and calling the admissions office, pretending to be their own children. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Writer Michael Lewis tells the story of a man named Emir Kamenica, whose path to college 
started with fleeing the war in Bosnia and becoming a refugee in the United States. Then he 
had a stroke of luck: a student teacher read an essay he’d plagiarized from a book he’d 
stolen from a library back in Bosnia, and was so impressed that she got him out of a bad high 
school and into a much better one. He went on to Harvard and great success. Years later, he 
tracks down the student teacher to thank her, only to find that she remembers the story differently. (34 minutes) _Michael Lewis_

Act Three
Michael Lewis’ story continues, and he figures out why Emir Kamenica insists on remembering, and telling, the story of his life the way he does — even when he finds out that some of the facts may be wrong. (14 minutes) _Michael Lewis_

      <description>One of the country's most popular over-the-counter painkillers — acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol — also kills the most people, according to data from the federal government. Over 150 Americans die each year on average after accidentally taking too much. And it requires a lot less to endanger you than you may know. We reported this alongside ProPublica. Their storieshereandhere.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass tells the story of Sarah Erush, a pharmacist at the Hospital of the University of 
Pennsylvania.  She was contacted by the Food and Drug Administration and encouraged to 
examine cases of acetaminophen overdose at her hospital. Erush was surprised by how 
little over the recommended dose of the drug resulted in liver damage and, for three 
patients, death. (10 minutes)

Act One
Reporter Sean Cole tells the history of getting warning labels onto acetaminophen bottles. In 1977 an FDA advisory panel recommended a warning about liver damage. It took 32 years before the FDA took their advice and mandated a label. As Cole notes: "The drug approval process is usually slow but not usually this slow. The FDA began with acetaminophen over 40 years ago in 1972. In that time, science has mapped the human genome, eradicated smallpox, we’ve cloned a sheep. And yet we still have not come up with final rules for safe usage and labeling of one of the most popular drugs in the country, of which more than 20 billion doses are sold each year." (24 minutes) _Sean Cole_

Act Two
Reporter Sean Cole explains the confusion over dosing for Infants Tylenol and Children’s Tylenol. The FDA could have mandated clearer labels that might have prevented infant deaths. But it chose not to, despite the urging of Tylenol’s manufacturer McNeil Consumer Healthcare. McNeil, for its part, could have pulled one of the products from the shelves, but it chose not to. (18 minutes) _Sean Cole_

      <description>A bank robber on an undercover mission. A teenage girl with the powers of a tiger. A vigilante seeking vengeance in Ciudad Juarez. All have secret identities. But not all of them chose those identities for themselves.

Prologue
Ira attempts to solve perhaps the most unsolvable mystery at the Trees of Mystery , in California: Exactly who is the voice of Paul Bunyan? (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
If you ever think about assuming a secret identity, you may want to take a little time to consider the possible consequences. Jon Ronson tells the tale of a bank robber who absolutely does not take that advice. Jon Ronson's most recent book is Frank . It's also a movie . You can read Tom Schoenberg's epic tale about Herson Torres and the attempted bank robberies in Bloomberg Businessweek . (22 minutes) _Jon Ronson_

Act Two
Elna Baker has a story about her teenage cousin, Navey Baker, who manages to have a secret identity while being a public figure at the same time: She's the school mascot — a tiger — at her high school. (11 minutes) _Elna Baker_

Act Three
While we were putting together this week's show, we heard about a real life avenger with a secret identity in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Writer Yuri Herrera lived on the border for several years and spent a lot of time in Juarez. He went back there to see the what effect this secret avenger has had on the city. Yuri Herrera's books are available in Spanish . His latest is “ A Silent Fury: The El Bordo Mine Fire .” We commissioned this artwork of Diana the Hunter on the bus to go with his story from this artist named Alice Leora Briggs , who does incredible drawings of scenes from Juarez. (13 minutes)

      <description>Two crime scenes, two murders. One crime is solved, the other case went cold. Both raise the question: What should a person suspected of murder say?

Prologue
Ira talks to Father Thomas Santa about the kind of confession that he finds among the most difficult to listen to — and not because what’s being confessed is too big or too horrible — but because, as Father Santa explains, they aren’t sins at all. (10 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Former DC police detective Jim Trainum tells reporter Saul Elbein about how his first murder investigation went horribly wrong. He and his colleagues pinned the crime on the wrong woman, and it took 10 years and a revisit to her videotaped confession to realize how much, unbeknownst to Jim at the time, he was one of the main orchestrators of the botched confession. (28 minutes) _Saul Elbein_

Act Two
A person is accused of a murder he didn't commit. But in this story there is no false confession. Jeffrey Womack spent most of his adult life as a suspect in one of Nashville's most notorious crimes. And for all that time — until another man was convicted of the crime — Jeffrey refused to be questioned about it. Producer Lisa Pollak tells the story. Demetria Kalodimos' documentary Indelible: The Case Against Jeffrey Womack can be seen here . Jeffrey Womack and his attorney John Hollins Sr. have told their story in a book called The Suspect: A Memoir . It was ghostwritten by Nashville journalist E. Thomas Wood. (14 minutes) _Lisa Pollak_

      <description>We answer the following questions about superpowers: Can superheroes be real people? (No.) Can real people become superheroes? (Maybe.) And which is better: flight or invisibility? (Depends who you ask.)

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks to comic artist Chris Ware, who thought about superheroes a lot of the time as a kid. He invented his own character and made a superhero costume, which he wore to school under his regular clothes. Everything went fine until he realized he would have to change for gym class. Here's the Chris Ware comic mentioned in the episode. His book, Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth , is also inhabited by a "superhero" of sorts. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
John Hodgman conducts an informal survey in which he asks the age-old question: Which is better: The power of flight or the power of invisibility? John hosts the podcast Judge John Hodgman . (14 minutes) _John Hodgman_

Act Two
Kelly McEvers with the story of Zora, a self-made superhero. From the time she was five years old, Zora had recurring dreams in which she was a 6'5" warrior queen, who could fly and shoot lightning from her hands. She made a list, pages and pages long, of all the things she could accomplish to actually become that superhero: martial arts, evasive driving, bomb defusing. By the time she was 30, most of her list had been checked off. She was as close to a superhero as any mortal could hope to come. But her dream had changed. Kelly McEvers hosts the NPR podcast Embedded . (17 minutes) _Kelly McEvers_

Act Three
Ira talks with Jonathan Morris, the amazingly funny and charming editor of the website "Gone and Forgotten," an internet archive of failed comic book characters. Jonathan explains what makes a new superhero succeed, and what makes him tank. (9 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Four
Of course you can’t be a superhero without a supervillain trying to destroy you. And the most interesting supervillains, of course, are the ones who think that they're the real heroes, not the guys in the capes. Glynn Washington tells the story of Evil D. This story was first heard on Snap Judgment . (9 minutes) _Glynn Washington_

      <description>Everyone knows you can't always believe what you read, but sometimes even official documents aren't a path to the truth. This week we have stories of people whose lives are altered when seemingly boring documents like birth certificates and petitions are used against them. And a family wrestles with a medical record that has a very clear, but complicated diagnosis.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass tells the story of man in Florida named Lanail Hudson who it turned out wasn't 
actually Lanail Hudson. He had stolen Lanail Hudson's identity and had been using his name 
for decades. And even after he was caught and incarcerated, he refused to tell authorities what his real name was. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Our story from the prologue continues. (12 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Huntington's Disease is a progressive brain disorder. There's a wide range of symptoms, but in the worst cases, people who have it can end up losing physical control of their bodies, sort of like Parkinson's Disease, and can also have mental symptoms that are like Alzheimer's or schizophrenia. If you have a parent with Huntington's Disease, you have a 50-50 chance of getting it. In this audio diary, a woman named Kelly has decided to get tested for the disease. Her mother has Huntington's and several of her family members have either been diagnosed, or are showing symptoms of the disease. Paige Cowett of WNYC produced Kelly's audio diary. The story is part of a project called “The Antidote." There's more information about "The Antidote," and a video of Kelly and her niece Kayla, at the WNYC website . (12 minutes) _Paige Cowett_

Act Three
Producer Ben Calhoun tells the story of Josh Inglett. Josh was a college student from Portage, Wisconsin who was appointed to the Board of Regents for the University of Wisconsin system. Josh was everything you'd want in a student who was going to fulfill this role. That is, until Governor Scott Walker's administration discovered something on Josh's permanent record that they considered a problem. (28 minutes) _Ben Calhoun_

      <description>Stories of when things go wrong. Really wrong. When you leave the normal realm of human error, fumble, mishap, and mistake and enter the territory of really huge breakdowns. Fiascos. Things go so awry that normal social order collapses.

Prologue
Jack Hitt tells the story of a small town production of Peter Pan in which the flying apparatus smacks the actors into the furniture, and Captain Hook's hook flies off his arm and hits an old woman in the stomach. By the end of the evening, firemen have arrived and all the normal boundaries between audience and actors have completely dissolved. (4 minutes) _Jack Hitt_

Act One
Jack Hitt's Peter Pan story continues. Jack is the author of several books, including Bunch of Amateurs . (19 minutes) _Jack Hitt_

Act Two
A medieval village, a 1900-pound brass kettle, marauding visigoths, and a plan to drench invaders with boiling oil that goes awry. From Ron Carlson's book, The Hotel Eden: Stories , read by actor Jeff Dorchen. Ron Carlson's newest book is Return To Oakpine . (9 minutes) _Ron Carlson_

Act Three
The first day on the job inevitably means mistakes, mishaps, and sometimes... fiascos. A true story, told by a former rookie cop. (13 minutes)

Act Four
Journalist Margy Rochlin on her first big assigment to do a celebrity interview. It was 1982. The interviewee was Moon Unit Zappa, who'd just released "Valley Girl" with her father Frank. She'd only been interviewed once. Midway through the interview: fiasco! Margy chokes on some coffee, which pumps out of her nose. Moon's mother administers the Heimlich Maneuver. And after that, everyone's so relaxed that Margy gets an interview that becomes her first syndicated article and a big scoop for her paper. When a fiasco destroys social boundaries, it can bring people together. (7 minutes) _Margy Rochlin_

      <description>Producer Sarah Koenig's mother lives by a set of rules about conversation. She has an actual list of off-limits topics, including how you slept, your period, your health, your diet and more. You don't talk about these things, she says, because nobody cares. This week we try to find stories on these exact topics that will prove her wrong.

Prologue
Sarah's mom, Mrs. Matthiessen, doubts that the staff of This American Life can find great stories about her conversational no-nos. (7 minutes)

Act One
Okay, so we admit, that this story that a woman named Ninon told Sarah at a dinner party isn’t 
strictly about menstruation, but we're going to beg indulgence because it has all the key 
ingredients of a good menstruation story. (7 minutes)

Act Two
Dr. Steven Bratman has spent a lot of time around people with extreme and unusual diets. He tells Ira Glass that for some of them, it's not about losing weight but about becoming more pure. Dr. Bratman is the author of Health Food Junkies . (7 minutes)

Act Three
Deborah Lott comes from a family that obsesses over health. And when they all get together for dinner, their banter goes on overdrive. She recorded their last dinner party, and assures producer Brian Reed that this is a typical dinner for them. Deborah recently completed a memoir, Tell Me I’m Still Breathing: A Memoir of an Anxious Childhood . You can find more of her work at her website . (10 minutes)

Act Four
Dr. Cady Coleman is a NASA astronaut who has spent more than 4300 hours in space. Our senior 
producer Julie Snyder asked her what it's like to sleep while orbiting the earth. (3 minutes)

Act Five
A group of people have a dream club that meets twice a month to talk about their dreams. Sarah 
and her mom join one of their meetings. (7 minutes)

Act Six
Chris Garcia and his dad were driving home, listening to oldies, sharing a bag of chips. A totally familiar scene for them. They’d driven this route probably hundreds of time, but something odd was happening in the car, so Chris started recording their conversation on his phone. He tells producer Nancy Updike what happened. Chris is a comedian. We first heard him talking about his dad on Marc Maron's WTF podcast (Chris's part starts around at around 30:30). You can find more of his comedy at his website . (10 minutes)

      <description>Where you live is important. It can dictate quality of schools and hospitals, as well as things like cancer rates, unemployment, or whether the city repairs roads in your neighborhood. On this week's show, stories about destiny by address.

Prologue
Ira talks to 15 year old Jada who, when she was in third grade, moved from Akron Public Schools in Ohio, to the nearby Copley-Fairlawn schools in the suburbs. After two years, Jada was kicked out by administrators who discovered that her mother was using Jada's grandfather's address in Copley, instead of her own in Akron. Jada says that while the schools are only a few miles apart, the difference in education was astounding. For more information about Jada and her mother, Kelley Williams Bolar, who spent 10 days in jail because she falsified documents so she could enroll Jada and her sister in the Copley-Fairlawn schools, you can go here . (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Reporter Nancy Updike talks to a group of New York City residents about their frustrating attempts to rent an apartment. With hidden microphones, we hear landlords and supers tell the apartment hunters that there's nothing available. But that's not necessarily true. Forty-five years after the passage of the Fair Housing Act in 1968, ProPublica reporter Nikole Hannah-Jones talks to Nancy about the history of racial housing discrimination in the United States and what has been done — and hasn't been done — to rectify it. (31 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Two
Once the Fair Housing Act became law in 1968, there was some question about how to implement it and enforce it. George Romney, the former Republican Governor of Michigan and newly-appointed Secretary of HUD, was a true believer in the need to make the Fair Housing Law a powerful one — a robust attempt to change the course of the nation's racial segregation. Only problem was: President Richard Nixon didn't necessarily see it that way. With Nikole Hannah-Jones, Nancy Updike continues the story. Nikole Hannah-Jones's investigative series on the history and enforcement of the Fair Housing laws — with more stories, research and interviews — is here . (16 minutes) _Nikole Hannah-Jones_

      <description>We spend a month at aJeep dealership on Long Islandas they try to make their monthly sales goal: 129 cars. If they make it, they'll get a huge bonus from the manufacturer, possibly as high as $85,000 — enough to put them in the black for the month. If they don't make it, it'll be the second month in a row. So they pull out all the stops.

Prologue
It’s mid-October, 2013. Freddie Hoyt tries to rally his sales staff to sell 129 cars and trucks by the end of the month. Freddie’s the General Manager at Town and Country Jeep Chrysler Dodge Ram in Levittown, NY, on Long Island. Problem is, the customers are not cooperating. (7 1/2 minutes)

Act One
How we found this car dealer. (2 minutes)

Act Two
A quick primer of who’s who, and how the place works. (6 minutes)

Act Three
Salesman Bob Tantillo has the fewest sales of anyone at Town and Country this month. Robyn Semien spoke to him. (4 minutes) _Robyn Semien_

Act Four
Salesman Jason Mascia has the most sales of anyone this month, as usual. Sean Cole spent a week with him watching how he does it. (8 minutes) _Sean Cole_

Act Five
The next-to-last day of the month. Deals fall apart, but not all of them. (10 minutes)

Act Six
The last day of the month begins. They have to sell nine cars by the end of the day. "God help us," Freddie says. (2 minutes)

Act Seven
Joe Monti’s real name is Joe Montalbano. But when he started in the car business, he didn't want to lose a sale because a customer couldn’t keep his name straight so he simplified it for the job. He's one of the managers of the used cars department at Town and Country. Sarah Koenig reports on what it'll mean if he doesn’t make this month’s goal. (7 minutes) _Sarah Koenig_

Act Eight
The last day of the month continues and the truism is accurate: some people get great deals because it’s the end of the month and they have to hit their goal. When you look at the numbers, the average car they sell in the last two days actually loses money. (4 minutes)

Act Nine
Salesman Manny Rosales keeps to himself in the showroom, with his own sales philosophy. He explained it to Brian Reed. (7 minutes) _Brian Reed_

Act Ten
The last day of the month ends. (8 minutes)

      <description>It's the thought that counts. So true. Unfortunately, sometimes it's not always so clear what that thought was. And sometimes, when it is clear, we wish it wasn't. This week, during this, the season of giving, we turn our spotlight on the givers and exactly whatever it was they could've possibly been thinking.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass speaks to teenagers at the Arundel Mills Mall in Maryland about something that's difficult for so many teenagers: finding Christmas presents for their parents. He talks to Kevin and Karyn Delauder and their dad JD, and two other teens, Gage and William. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Jonathan Goldstein tells the story of Santa Claus, who, after losing his wife, Martha Claus, sets out to find love once again. Jonathan's the host of podcast/radio show Wiretap , which is heard on the CBC and on many public radio stations in this country. Then 19-year-old Larry Daniels at Arundel Mills Mall explains to Ira what he's bought for his parents in the past, and why he's never asked them what they want for Christmas. (17 minutes) _Jonathan Goldstein_

Act Two
Starlee Kine tells the story of hundreds of boxes left behind by the late Andy Warhol. The boxes, an art project he titled " Time Capsules ," includes hundreds of thousands of objects from all parts of his life. It's taken museum staff at the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh decades to sort it all out, and try to make sense of what's included. (11 minutes) _Starlee Kine_

Act Three
Writer Russell Banks tells the story of a teenager, estranged from his family, who plans a triumphant return home for the holidays. But when he puts his plan into action, it drives his family further away, and simultaneously puts him on the wrong side of the law. Banks is the author most recently of a short story collection A Permanent Member of the Family . A version of this story is in his novel Rule of the Bone . To end the show, a 16-year-old employee at the Orange Julius-Dairy Queen at Arundel Mills Mall tells Ira the incredible Christmas gift she has planned for her mom. (13 minutes) _Russell Banks_

      <description>Yes fellas, lots of you think of yourselves as good guys. But what does it really take to be a good guy? We have stories of valiant men attempting to do good in challenging circumstances: in war zones, department stores, public buses, and at the bottom of a cave 900 feet underground.

Prologue
Producer Ben Calhoun tells Ira about a secret move his friend uses all the time — the "good guy discount" — that gets Ben's friend money off all sorts of items when he's shopping. (6 minutes) _Ben Calhoun_

Act One
Ben tries the good guy discount, to see if he can pull it off, as Ira tags along. (7 minutes) _Ben Calhoun_

Act Two
Mike Birbiglia has this story about a time his good guy-ness was called into question. (7 minutes) _Mike Birbiglia_

Act Three
Julia DeWitt tells the story of someone who goes to incredible lengths to do a favor for another guy, even though the guy won't ever be able to know about it. Julia's story originally aired on Snap Judgment . (16 minutes) _Julia DeWitt_

Act Four
In 2009, a U.S. soldier contacted our show and offered to send audio dispatches from his deployment in Afghanistan, to do a story about what it's really like to go to war. But what he learned when he was over there was way more personal and honest than we, or he, expected. Producer Sarah Koenig explains. Note: Ira warns listeners that this story may not be appropriate for children. (20 minutes)

      <description>Jan Brady is not the only one who hated being in the middle. This week we have stories about how it sucks to be in limbo or be the mediator, but we also hear from a man who absolutely loves being in that uncertain and boring middle most of us dread — on hold, listening to hold music.

Prologue
Rachel has two kids. Elias, age seven, is a vegetarian. Theo, age five, is not. But Elias wants Theo, and everyone else in the house, to be vegetarian too. So Rachel and her husband are in the middle of negotiating the desires of two very strong willed kids.

Act One
Sara Corbett 's father-in-law Dick is 81. And he's become obsessed with a limbo most of us hate – the music he hears whenever he's on hold. Sara is co-author of the book A House in the Sky . Here is the hold music, Opus No. 1 . _Sara Corbett_

Act Two
Mark Oppenheimer reports on agunah in the Orthodox Jewish community. An agunah is a woman whose husband refuses to give her a divorce – in Hebrew it means "chained wife." If you're an Orthodox Jew, strictly following Jewish law, the only real way to get divorced is if your husband agrees to hand you a piece of paper called a get. Without the get, women who want out of their marriages can stay chained to their husbands for years. In New York, a couple of rabbis were recently accused of using violence to force men to give their wives a get. Mark writes the Beliefs column for The New York Times. _Mark Oppenheimer_

Act Three
Sarah Carr is a reporter and blogger in Cairo, Egypt. Her blog inanities.org is regularly cited as one of Egypt's best blogs and English language news sources coming out of Egypt. She tells us what things are like in Egypt during their middle period – the transitional phase that started three years ago when people took to the streets, eventually resulting in the army ousting Hosni Mubarak after 30 years of authoritarian rule. _Sarah Carr_

      <description>It's January, and freezing outside. This week 5 stories from the sunny beach! Including David Sedaris telling us how losing a sister in 2013 prompted a family reunion, and an impulse buy of a lifetime — an oceanfront cottage big enough for all of them.

Prologue
All over the United States there are ice storms and blizzards. Today we get away from all of that, first to sunny California. We hear from Sharon Jacobucci , who loves to work, and she’s got one of the stickiest jobs — she’s a parking attendant. But that’s no matter to her, because she works along Venice beach, where the weather is warm and the view is always great. (4 minutes)

Act One
Alex Blumberg talks to Shane Dubow about a time decades ago, when Shane went sea kayaking and camping with his friends on the beach in Baja California, Mexico. When Shane’s neck stiffens up on him, he finds himself looking for an unlikely chiropractor, in the middle of nowhere. (11 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

Act Two
Comedian Sam Mullins tells a story onstage about being in middle school, and throwing a party for his longtime childhood friend, who is also a girl. Sam sees the beach party as the perfect opportunity to impress a bunch of teenage girls in bathing suits. Only when the moment comes, things go so horribly wrong that Sam winds up half naked, injured and crying for his mom. (10 minutes) _Sam Mullins_

Act Three
Note : This story only appears in the podcast version of the show. This clip is from what Ira calls “the beachiest show” public radio ever made. It’s a segment from NPR’s 1970’s show, Ocean Hour . In it we hear from a man who lives on the beach, literally. He explains how it provides him everything he needs to survive. You can hear the original hour of radio, which included The Beachcomber, here . Courtesy of National Public Radio, Inc. (3 minutes)

Act Four
David Sedaris comes from a big family, who for many years growing up, took annual vacations to the same beach house. In this story, David tells us about losing a sister last year, and how her death prompted a family reunion back at the beach. David is the author of many books, including Let's Explore Diabetes with Owls . (27 minutes) _David Sedaris_

      <description>Mike Anderson was 36 years old, married, a suburban father of four. He owned a contracting business and built his family’s modest, three-bedroom house in St. Louis from the ground up. He volunteered at church on the weekends and coaches his son’s football team. All pretty normal, right? Except for one thing … which surfaced one day two summers ago.

Prologue
When Mike and Sara bought their first house, they didn’t have much money for furniture. So they 
looked for bargains at yard sales and estate auctions and finally, Sara found the perfect piece of 
furniture on eBay. Great-looking at a great price, it was ideal, except for one thing. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Lots of us have things about us that we keep to ourselves. Mike Anderson had something like that, something he kept secret even from his wife, until the day the truth came out. Jessica Lussenhop reports. Her original story about Anderson appeared in the St. Louis newspaper Riverfront Times . (16 minutes) _Jessica Lussenhop_

Act Two
A piece of fiction by BJ Novak called "Julie and the Warlord" that with his help, we’ve turned into a radio drama. It’s from his new book of short stories One More Thing: Stories and Other Stories . Alison Brie plays Julie; Tunde Adebimpe plays the Warlord. Alison’s on Community and in The Lego Movie . Tunde’s new project Higgins Waterproof Black Magic Band has an EP that's out now on iTunes. Details and tour schedule at hwbmb.com . (9 minutes) _BJ Novak_

Act Three
Producer Alex Blumberg interviews the writer Jon Mooallem, who just wrote a story for the Atavist about a period in the early 1900’s when meat was scarce in the United States. A group of forward-thinking men had a plan to fix that problem. It was ingenious in every way except for one. Jon’s story is also an Amazon Kindle single . (12 minutes) _Alex Blumberg, Jon Mooallem_

Act Four
Comedian Tig Notaro tells an audience at the club Largo in Los Angeles about the day she tried to introduce a sixth grade class to the music of The Rolling Stones. Tig’s the host of the podcast Professor Blastoff . Her comedy CDs and tour schedule are at Tignation.com . (3 1/2 minutes) _Tig Notaro_

      <description>Last May, a weird story made the news: the FBI killed a guy in Florida who was loosely linked to the Boston Marathon bombings. He was shot seven times in his living room by a federal agent. What really happened? Why was the FBI even in that room with him? A reporter spent six months looking into it, and she found that the FBI was doing a bunch of things that never made the news. HerBoston Magazinestory.

Prologue
Ira explains that in May 2013, the FBI shot a guy named Ibragim Todashev in his living room in 
Florida. Supposedly, right before he died, Todashev implicated himself in a crime, a pretty 
gruesome one, a triple murder of three drug dealers in Waltham Massachusetts, a Boston suburb.  
Law enforcement officials told reporters that he also named one of the alleged Boston Marathon 
bombers – Tamerlan Tsarnaev – as his accomplice in the crime. And then, right before he signed 
a confession, he supposedly freaked out, and an FBI agent shot him. Which is weird in itself. But 
weirder still is the fact that the FBI has been silent about what happened. They first promised an 
investigation on this last May. And since then, we’ve heard that it’s coming, but nine months later it hasn’t arrived. So many questions remain: what happened during that interrogation that led to them shooting Ibragim Todashev? If they had such good evidence connecting him to these 
murders, why didn’t they just arrest him? What evidence did they have? How good is the evidence 
connecting the alleged Boston bomber to the murders? Do they truly know who committed the 
triple murders? In the absence of solid information, conspiracy theories sprang up. Some people 
started to believe the FBI was hiding something. (7 minutes)

Act One
Susan Zalkind spent six months investigating all this for Boston Magazine and This American Life . And she has a personal connection to the 2011 triple murder. She knew one of the three drug dealers who were killed: Erik Weissman was a friend of hers. In this half of the show, she explains what happened when she reached out to people who might have information on Ibragim Todashev, the man killed by the FBI in Florida. First his girlfriend Tatiana Gruzdeva and then his best friend Khusen Taramov are more or less kicked out of the country by federal authorities. Tatiana says she was told she was deported specifically because she spoke with Susan for a story. (17 minutes) _Susan Zalkind_

Act Two
Susan’s investigation continues, and she tells the story of a third person who was close to Ibragim Todashev who was whisked out of the United States after actions by the FBI. (20 minutes) _Susan Zalkind_

Act Three
Susan lays out her theory of what the truth is in this case. And she explains what we still don’t know. (14 minutes) _Susan Zalkind_

      <description>There are lots of ways we define where we're from. And whether we're proud of it, or ashamed of it, love it, hate it, miss it or are trying desperately to get back to it — where we're from is always a big part of who we are. This week, stories of people who are, in good ways and bad ways, coming to terms with the places they call home.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass tell the story of a city pride campaign in Calgary, Canada. He speaks with life-long Calgarian Ken Lima-Cuelho who explains how much people in the city loved the campaign — and the song at the center of it, "Hello Calgary." Except, Ira, and the song's composer, Frank Gari , have some bad news for Ken. (8 minutes)

Act One
James Spring tells the story of the "Caminata Nocturna" — a simulated illegal border crossing run by a small town in Mexico. The event was recently criticized by conservative media as a training camp for illegal immigration. Spring explains that the Caminata Noctura actually caters to middle-class and upperclass Mexicans — people who would never attempt to sneak into the US. He also explains that the whole thing was actually created with hopes to keep people in Mexico, not send them away. James did a Spanish language version of this story for Radio Ambulante . (18 minutes) _James Spring_

Act Two
Seth Freed Wessler reports on people going the opposite direction over the US/Mexico border. 
Each year hundreds of thousands of people are deported from the US to Mexico — tens of 
thousands more choose to leave on their own — and lots of them make the journey after years and years living in the states. Wessler explains how customer service call centers in Mexico are capitalizing on the fact that many of these people speak English with American accents. They're hiring such people, and using them to staff customer service lines for American companies. But, for those who've left the US, taking calls over and over from the place they used to call home, it can be a complicated experience. (11 minutes) _Seth Freed Wessler_

Act Three
John Gravois tells the story of a potentially annoying San Francisco food trend: artisanal toast. John explains how, in fact, the trend's origins are very down to earth, and more heroic than annoying. John wrote a version of this story for Pacific Standard magazine , where he is an editor. (17 minutes) _John Gravois_

      <description>They're small. And they're cuddly. But sometimes it feels as though our babies were replaced with demon replicas—controlling, demanding, or just downright awful. This week, stories of infants and children who dominate the adults around them with their baditude, or whom adults have painted with the "bad" brush from early on. We also ask the question: at what age does badness begin?

Prologue
Ira talks to "Cheryl," an anonymous blogger who's been documenting life with an 8-year-old son who seems to take pleasure in causing chaos. He's tried to kill his little brother more than once. He broke Cheryl's nose after asking for a hug. She and her husband have tried everything they can think of to control him and treat his condition but they're not even sure what's wrong. (10 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Ira plays tape from an interview that he did more than 20 years ago, with the author Doris Lessing, about her novel The Fifth Child , which tells the story of a woman who gives birth to a goblin-like baby. The archival audio appears courtesy of National Public Radio, Inc. Then Ira's conversation with Cheryl, from the top of the show, continues. She talks about the impossible decision she's facing: whether to keep her son in the home or to send him away in order to protect her other two kids. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Yale psychologist Paul Bloom tells Ira about his research into the morality of babies and young 
children. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
Producer Jonathan Menjivar tells the story of a bad baby who stopped being bad. At two years old, Comedian Chris Gethard had a knack for dancing on his mother's last nerve. Finally, Chris's father decided drastic measures were in order. Chris just released his first comedy album called My Comedy Album . (12 minutes) _Jonathan Menjivar_

Act Four
Producer Sean Cole tells the story of a former foster kid who was finally adopted in his mid-30's,
and the reason he was taken away from the foster family he loved more than 20 years ago. (17 minutes) _Sean Cole_

Act Five

      <description>This week, stories of people being threatened and punished with public shame. Including the story of someone who was literally tarred and feathered. It happened a lot more recently than you'd guess.

Prologue
When we started putting together this week's show, we assumed we'd be using the phrase "tarred and feathered" as a metaphor for when someone is publicly shamed. We didn't think we'd find a story about someone being literally tarred and feathered, especially not recently. But then we heard about the story of Jock Nelson. Ira talks to Jon Ronson about what happened to Jock in 2007. (10 minutes) _Jon Ronson_

Act One
Gene Cooley had just suffered a huge tragedy, and he was trying to move on. But suddenly 
anonymous posters started saying horrible things about him on a website called Topix. The horrible 
things weren't true. But that didn't stop the people in Gene's small town — a town of just 600 people — from believing them. (18 minutes) _Stephanie Foo_

Act Two
There's one group of people that is universally tarred and feathered in the United States and most of the world. We never hear from them, because they can't identify themselves without putting their livelihoods and reputations at risk. That group is pedophiles. It turns out lots of them desperately want help, but because it's so hard to talk about their situation it's almost impossible for them to find it. Reporter Luke Malone spent a year and a half talking to people in this situation, and he has this story about one of them. More of Luke Malone's reporting on this topic is available on Medium.com . (27 minutes) _Luke Malone_

      <description>It is a peculiar feeling to know with certainty that something big is about to happen to you. This week, we watch people go right up to the edge of inevitable change.

Prologue
When you're a preteen, you walk around every day with the knowledge that your body is about to change. You don’t know exactly when or how. All you know is that it will happen and you will come out the other side a different person. We hear from kids who are reluctantly facing puberty any minute now. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Producer Nancy Updike takes some personal questions about death and dying to a place where they're happening all the time. (36 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Two
Al Drucker used to work for the IRS doing tax enforcement. One thing he found really helpful in the job was when someone from the public would give a tip on who he should look into. So when Al retired from the IRS five years ago, he created a website where you can anonymously rat out your neighbors, exes, and friends to the IRS. (13 minutes) _David Kestenbaum_

      <description>Your waitress. Your colleagues at work. Your doctor. Maybe even your parents. They’re all high. All the time. That’s what it feels like anyway. This week, stories in which drug use and daily life intersect – and in which people get high in secret and then do their best to function in the non-high world. Also, we hear some “I Was So High” stories from our very own listeners.

Prologue
Producer Sean Cole heads to Toronto to see if it was true what he heard: that lots and lots of the 
bartenders who used to serve him drinks there were on coke at the time. Then Sean takes Ira 
through a catalogue of the various professions in which people tend to get high. (9 minutes) _Sean Cole_

Act One
Producer Alex Blumberg introduces us to Richard, a former executive at a big time marketing firm 
who smoked pot daily — sometimes at work. As it turns out, Alex is intimately familiar with how Richard's getting high kept him from focusing on the important things in his life. (16 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

Act Two
Our listeners sent us 2,600 emails with their own getting high stories. Contributor Elna Baker read a ton of them (other staffers read the rest). Elna then interviewed several people who wrote in, and determined that the "I Was So High" story is a particularly difficult genre to get right. One listener comes through with flying, psychedelic colors — telling us about the time he took mushrooms before appearing as a contestant on The Price is Right . (7 minutes) _Elna Baker, Ira Glass_

Act Three
Comedian Wyatt Cenac tells the story of the first time he ever tried marijuana. He didn't smoke it. He ate a pot brownie. He then managed to convince himself that he had now acquired adult onset Down Syndrome. (And no, that does not exist.) (6 minutes) _Wyatt Cenac_

Act Four
Comedian Marc Maron, who's been off drugs for more than 15 years, says he still thinks it's okay to laugh at funny drug stories. And then he tells us one of the funniest we heard while putting this show together. (11 minutes) _Ira Glass, Marc Maron_

Act Five
Producer Brian Reed recounts one of the more riveting arguments he's ever heard about whether marijuana is dangerous or relatively benign. It takes place in Congress. On one side, a congressman who isn't even on the committee that organized the hearing. On the other side, a DEA official who says that pot insults our common values as Americans. (5 minutes) _Brian Reed_

      <description>Stories of people coming to terms with being in serious trouble. They need help. Figuring out how to get it, that's another problem.

Prologue
Ira brings up a story that got a lot of attention last year, in the New York Times and also on a lot of morning news shows. A couple was sailing across the Pacific Ocean with their two small children, and after three weeks of sailing they signaled for help — which came in the form of four National Guardsmen and a navy vessel. All the coverage seemed to be asking the same question: Are these bad parents? The couple involved, Eric and Charlotte Kaufman, had been silent about what happened on their boat, until talking to Ira. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Ira finds out more about what Eric and Charlotte Kaufman’s sailing trip was meant to be, how 
prepared they were for such an extensive trip, and exactly what went wrong on their sailboat that 
led to the dramatic rescue for which they were so roundly criticized. (14 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
Reporter Anna Sale tells the story of the high profile politician who came to her with an issue that had nothing to do with politics and nothing to do with him. Instead it had everything to do with Anna and the state of her love life. A version of this story appears on Anna's podcast Death, Sex and Money , produced by WNYC. (16 minutes) _Anna Sale_

Act Three
Producer Chana Joffe-Walt talks to her 13 year old sister Maya about Maya’s most important friendship to date. In fact, it’s her first real friendship. Chana’s mom and partner — Maya’s parents — have always known that their daughter wasn’t your average girl. But they weren’t worried about that. They were worried that Maya should have a friend. And now that she’s found one, the only question is, for how long? (18 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt_

      <description>You've been seeing yourself, getting to know what you look like, your whole life. So why does it often take an outsider to see things about you that are obvious, and set you straight?

Prologue
Guest host Nancy Updike talks about learning something new, and unpleasant, about herself in — where else — a makeup store. She also talks with other people about moments where someone made an observation about them that was shocking. (8 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act One
Writer Domingo Martinez tells a story from his memoir The Boy Kings of Texas , about when he was forced to face how he might look in 20 years, if he kept doing what he was doing. (12 minutes) _Domingo Martinez_

Act Two
A woman, who got in a car accident and was in a coma for 52 days, woke up having forgotten the last two years of her life — during which she'd divorced her husband. Producer Miki Meek spent a week with this family, in the midst of their difficult situation. (14 minutes) _Miki Meek_

Act Three
Producer Ben Calhoun talks about the moment when the cool teacher at school told the girls they should pay attention to Ben, and they did. Then Ira Glass interviews actress Molly Ringwald about what happened when she watched one of her own movies, The Breakfast Club , with her daughter. (22 minutes)

      <description>Flipflops, u-turns, changes of heart, about faces. Completely changing our position — sometimes it can be our best move, sometimes it can be our worst. Either way, it's usually complicated. This week we bring you stories of people who go one way, and then, for what ever reason, turn around and go the exact opposite direction.

Prologue
Host Alex Blumberg talks about New York City’s long-standing ban on ferrets. And how, after 
years of forbidding them, the city is now poised to lift the ban. You’d think ferret proponents — 
there are ferret proponents — would be really really happy. You’d also be wrong. (7 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

Act One
Alex Blumberg takes us to an American classroom where students are reading a classic, The Education of Little Tree , by Forrest Carter. The book is marketed as a simple homespun autobiography of a Cherokee orphan. But Radio Diaries ' Joe Richman explains that the book is not at all what it seems. The origins of the heartwarming tale of respect for nature and tolerance, are actually filled with hatred, racism and lies. This story was produced by Joe Richman, Sarah Kate Kramer and Samara Freemark of Radio Diaries with help from Nellie Gilles, Deborah George, and Ben Shapiro. Here's the Radio Diaries podcast , where people can hear the original non-narrated version of this story. (31 minutes) _Alex Blumberg, Samara Freemark, Sarah Kate Kramer, Joe Richman_

Act Two
Chana Joffe-Walt tells the story of a teenager named Michael. Like a lot of teenagers Michael 
decides to follow his dreams — and that to follow his dreams, he’s going to need to make a total 
change. He does that. And then, like so many of us when we’re teenagers, Michael decides after a 
lot of trouble, that it was all a big mistake. He need to reverse his reversal. A double 180. That’s when things get complicated. (11 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt_

Act Three
Writer Ben Loory has a short story about the 180 none of us can escape. It’s from his collection, Stories for the Nighttime and Some for the Day . (5 minutes) _Ben Loory_

      <description>Our most ambitious live show ever! We pulled together a massive team of theater pros at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Opera House—nearly 50 singers, actors, dancers and musicians. The result? Journalism turned into a Broadway musical, into opera. Mike Birbiglia, Sasheer Zamata, Stephin Merritt, Josh Hamilton, Lindsay Mendez, Lin-Manuel Miranda and others.

Prologue
Carin Gilfry explains how she once accidentally locked herself in a hotel closet, and because 
today’s show is being broadcast from an opera house stage, Ira is able to take the story to a place 
he never usually can. (18 minutes)

Act One
Lin-Manuel Miranda turns a piece of reporting we broadcast in 2012, into a 14-minute Broadway mini-musical, created by people who normally work on Broadway. The Original Cast Album of “21 Chump Street: The Musical” is now on iTunes , Amazon , and Spotify . (18 minutes) _Lin-Manuel Miranda_

Act Two
Comedian Mike Birbiglia , his wife, and his cat take a trip together and meet some parasitic zombie mice. This story is from Mike's “ Thank God for Jokes ” show. (10 minutes) _Mike Birbiglia_

Act Three
Joshuah Bearman tells a story that’s a sequel to his memorable episode about his mother and half-brother David . It’s done onstage as a play that’s structured like a radio documentary, with Josh Hamilton playing Joshuah, and James Ransone playing his brother. (17 minutes) _Josh Bearman_

Act Four
Comedian Sasheer Zamata stages a radio play, complete with sound effects and comedians Nicole Byer, Chris Gethard, and Frank Garcia Hejl. It’s a true story about a recent bus accident. (9 minutes) _Sasheer Zamata_

      <description>Gladiators in the Colosseum. Sideshow performers. Reality television. We've always loved to gawk at the misery or majesty of others. But this week, we ask the question: What's it like when the tables are turned and all eyes are on you?

Prologue
Ira talks to Joel Gold, a psychologist and author, about a strangely common delusion known as the "Truman Show Delusion," in which patients believe that they are being filmed, 24/7, for a national reality television program. Joel wrote a book with his brother Ian called Suspicious Minds: How Culture Shapes Madness . (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Producer Stephanie Foo speaks to Nasubi, a Japanese comedian who, in the 90s, just wanted a little bit of fame. So he was thrilled when he won an opportunity to have his own segment on a Japanese reality TV show . Until he found out the premise: he had to sit in an empty apartment with no food, clothes or contact with the outside world, enter sweepstakes from magazines… and hope that he won enough sustenance to survive. (23 minutes) _Stephanie Foo_

Act Two
Writer Ariel Sabar tells the story of Roger Barker, a psychologist who believed that humans should be studied outside the lab. So Barker dispatched an army of graduate students to follow the children of Oskaloosa, Kansas, and write down every single thing they did. Sabar wrote a book — a Kindle Single — about Roger Barker, called The Outsider . (8 1/2 minutes) _Ariel Sabar_

Act Three
In Iraq, everyone from the militant group known as ISIS to the government security forces and shiite militias have been putting on such a deliberate show. Each faction has its own videos, parades, flags, propaganda and counter-propaganda. Plus the fighting. Together they make up a spectacle the entire country of Iraq — and really the whole world — is watching collectively. (16 1/2 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

A cellphone hidden in a bag of chips starts a messy turf war between the FBI and a local sheriff; and a surprising handbook lets us peek into the secret world of professional cheerleading. Plus: Studs Terkel.

Prologue
Ira plays excerpts from a 1966 episode of Studs Terkel 's WFMT radio show, with guest Mike Royko talking about a scandal. _Studs Terkel_

Act One
Earlier this year, a cheerleader named Lacy T filed a lawsuit against the Oakland Raiders for failing 
to pay her minimum wage.  NFL cheerleaders did the same right after... cheerleaders generally make 
about $1,500 for the entire season. What’s interesting is that the way they're trying to win is to argue 
that the teams exert so much control over their lives - they are so up in they business - that the 
cheerleaders deserve to be considered employees. Chana Joffe-Walt reports, and interviews 
producer - and former Lakers Girl - Robyn Semien (18 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt, Robyn Semien_

Act Two
There’s been a big, messy, fascinating story unfolding in Los Angeles for awhile… involving two big law enforcement agencies: the LA county sheriff’s department, which is huge, and the FBI. A secret investigation got exposed. There were accusations and counter-accusations, and clandestine recordings, and by the end, a bunch of people’s careers were over. Nancy Updike talks to Robert Faturechi , a reporter for the Los Angeles Times , about the story. (24 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

      <description>There is a special comfort that comes from knowing someone's got your back. You can do things that just weren't possible before. You take huge risks, including some that aren't necessarily advisable. This week: stories where one person's powerlessness is transformed when they discover they have backup. And we see what happens when that backup goes away.

Prologue
Ira talks to Grantland writer David Hill about the board game Diplomacy. He had a couple experiences that made him believe that maybe he didn't understand how to play properly. So he enlisted a ringer, an actual diplomat, to go with him to the national tournament in North Carolina. (8 minutes) _David Hill_

Act One
David Hill's story about what happened when he took U.S. Ambassador Dennis Ross as his coach to the World Championships for the board game Diplomacy. David writes about sports for Grantland.com, and wrote a story about the championship. (14 minutes) _David Hill_

Act Two
Ira plays audio of a phone call recorded by Ryan Block, who became Internet-famous after he posted audio of himself trying to cancel his Comcast account. Then Ira talks with David Segal, writer of the Haggler column in the New York Times , about getting the backs of consumers who need a champion. (7 minutes) _David Segal_

Act Three
There's this woman Hamida Gulistani who advocates for women's rights in Afghanistan. For a few years when the US presence in the country was at its greatest, she felt like someone had her back … she felt safer … she saw some progress. But now with the US pulling out, her situation's changing. It's gotten way more dangerous already, and she's shifted from someone having her back, to having to watch her back. For 2 1/2 years, Kevin Sieff has been the bureau chief for the Washington Post in Afghanistan. He tells this story about the change that Hamida is facing. Trigger warning: this story includes descriptions of violence against women. (24 minutes) _Kevin Sieff_

      <description>When Jonathan Goldstein was a kid, his father gave him a book that promised to teach you how to shoot mental laser beams, win the lottery, move solid objects with your mind, make others obey your command – all through the use of mental power and magic words. This week, he revisits the book to try to unlock the secrets within. And we have other stories where people recite words that have the power to change their lives, with no magic or mumbo jumbo at all.

Prologue
Ira talks to reporter Jake Halpern about a scene he saw take place in a Georgia courtroom where a couple uttered some magic words that seemed to make their debt disappear completely. Jake describes the scene in his new book, Bad Paper: Chasing Debt from Wall St. to the Underworld . (10 minutes) _Jake Halpern_

Act One
When Jonathan Goldstein was 11, his father gave him a book called Ultra-Psychonics: How to Work Miracles with the Limitless Power of Psycho-Atomic Energy . The book was like a grab bag of every occult, para-psychology, and self-help book popular at the time. It promised to teach you how to get rich, control other people's minds, and levitate. Jonathan found the book in his apartment recently and decided to look into the magical claims the book made. Jonathan Goldstein is host of the CBC radio show and podcast, Wiretap . (17 minutes) _Jonathan Goldstein_

Act Two
Producer Chana Joffe-Walt talks to a woman named Karen Stobbe and her husband Mondy about a plan they've recently enacted in their family. Karen's mother lives with them and she has dementia. Karen and Mondy are actors and they stumbled upon a skill they have that is incredibly useful in communicating with Karen's mother – improv. Karen Stobbe offers workshops on how to use the tools of improv with people who have dementia. (20 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt_

Act Three
We plays excerpts from Mike Pesca's podcast, The Gist , from Slate. Mike Pesca used to be the sports reporter for NPR, but The Gist isn't about sports. It's a daily show about the news and it's full of Mike's observations and dissections of the world around him. And one of the things that Mike notices often, is how words are used, and misused. (10 minutes) _Mike Pesca_

      <description>Starting a business is not for the self-doubting. Or even usually the self-deprecating. The first thing you have to sell is yourself — like dating, but with a greater chance of landing in debt. Alex Blumberg tells the incredible, sweat-stains-and-all saga of a man fumbling throughstarting a new business, and the man is: himself. Plus, new stories from Mike Birbiglia andLove + Radio.

Prologue
Ira talks to Planet Money reporter Zoe Chace about the day she spent with an 11-year-old entrepreneur named Asia Newson, who has a company called SuperBusinessGirl . Zoe says Asia is a natural at making people want to buy whatever she’s selling. She seems to instinctively understand a business principle that plenty of adult business owners miss: the first thing you have to sell people on is yourself. (10 1/2 minutes)

Act One
Longtime This American Life producer Alex Blumberg decided, a while back, to try and start his own business. He also decided to record the whole process, including investor meetings that go off the rails, and other tense and awkward moments that business reporters usually don’t get access to. Alex's new podcast, telling the story of trying to start a business that makes podcasts, is called StartUp . (20 minutes)

Act Two
A live recording of Mike Birbiglia telling a story about the very early days of his career. He talks about how getting into comedy is like starting up a business that no one wants; it’s all supply, no demand. Mike is on tour with a show called Thank God for Jokes . (8 1/2 minutes)

Act Three
This story, produced by the podcast Love+Radio , is the story of a woman throwing herself into a business plan that’s really an entire life plan. The piece is non-narrated—just a long interview with the young woman, named Taylor Rose Nations. (16 minutes)

      <description>We take it for granted that the majority calls the shots. But in one NY school district, that idea — majority rules — has led to an all-out war. School board disputes are pretty common, but not like this one. This involves multimillion-dollar land deals, lawyers threatening to beat up parents, felony criminal charges, and the highest levels of state government. Meanwhile, the students are caught in the middle.

Prologue
Before the war in the East Ramapo, New York school district, there was a truce. Local school officials made a deal with their Hasidic and ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighbors: we'll leave you alone to teach your children in private yeshivas as you see fit as long as you allow our public school budget to pass. But the budget is funded by local property taxes, which everyone, including the local Hasidim, have to pay — even though their kids don't attend the schools that their money is paying for. What followed was one of the most volatile local political battles we've ever encountered. (4 1/2 minutes) _Ben Calhoun_

Act One
Producer Ben Calhoun talks about how the truce in East Ramapo fell apart, and plumbs the depths
of the neighbor-vs-neighbor political war that emerged. Also, we learn that it can, in fact, be a 
massive deal when you change lawyers — at least when you're a school board. (25 minutes)

Act Two
Ben Calhoun's story on the East Ramapo school district feud continues. We hear from a former 
member of the board. And a lawyer working for the school board screams the worst possible swear
words we can think of at parents on the public school side. (Don't worry. We bleeped them for 
broadcast.) (26 minutes)

      <description>An unprecedented look inside one of the most powerful, secretive institutions in the country. The NY Federal Reserve is supposed to monitor big banks. But when Carmen Segarra was hired, what she witnessed inside the Fed was so alarming that she got a tiny recorder and started secretly taping.

Prologue
Ira introduces Carmen Segarra, a bank examiner for the Federal Reserve in New York who, in 2012, started secretly recording as she and her colleagues went about regulating one of the most powerful financial institutions in the country. This was during a time when the New York Fed was trying to become a stronger regulator, so that it wouldn't fail to miss another financial crisis like it did with the meltdown in 2008. As part of that effort to reform, the Fed had commissioned a highly confidential report, written by Columbia professor David Beim, that identified why the regulator failed in the years leading up to the crisis. Beim laid out specific recommendations for how the Fed could fix its problems. Carmen's recordings allow us to see if the Fed successfully heeded those recommendations more than two years later. What we hear is not reassuring.

Act One
ProPublica 's Jake Bernstein tells the story of Carmen's first months at the New York Fed, and how she came to start recording. And we hear the story of how the Fed examiners respond to an unusual, questionable deal that Goldman Sachs did — a deal that the top Fed guy stationed inside Goldman calls "legal but shady." _Jake Bernstein_

Act Two
We hear what the New York Fed and Goldman Sachs say about all this. We hear a New York Fed supervisor tell Carmen Segarra how an examiner should talk and act to be successful at the Fed. And we hear what happens to Carmen when she does exactly what David Beim's confidential report told the Fed it needed to encourage its examiners to do in order to spot the next financial crisis. _Brian Reed_

      <description>Baltimore, 1999. Hae Min Lee, a bright teenager, disappears after school one day. Six weeks later her ex-boyfriend Adnan Syed is arrested for her murder. He says he's innocent — though he can't remember what he was doing that afternoon. But someone can. A classmate at Woodlawn High School claims to know exactly where Adnan was. Trouble is, she’s nowhere to be found. This week features a pilot of our new podcast,Serial, hosted by Sarah Koenig.

Prologue
Ira explains that the show is different than usual this week. Instead of several acts surrounding a theme or even a single hour of This American Life , it's the first chapter of Serial , the new spin-off show from This American Life , hosted by Sarah Koenig. _Sarah Koenig_

Act One
Sarah Koenig tells the story of the murder of Hae Min Lee, a popular high-school senior in Baltimore County, Maryland. She disappeared after school one day in January, 1999. Six weeks after her disappearance, police arrested her ex-boyfriend, Adnan Syed, for the crime. Though he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison, he still maintains his innocence. But, he also can't really remember what he was doing on that January afternoon. As Sarah digs into the case, she learns that there's someone who does remember where Adnan was. _Sarah Koenig_

      <description>Stories of schools struggling with what to do with misbehaving kids. There's no general agreement about what teachers should do to discipline kids. And there's evidence that some of the most popular punishments actually may harm kids.

Prologue
When it comes to disciplining young people, teachers are winging it. We ask middle school teachers all over the country to walk us through how they get a kid to take his hat off. The book Ira mentions is called Building a Better Teacher by reporter Elizabeth Green; it’s eye-opening in a number of ways. (5 1/2 minutes)

Act One
We start out exploration of discipline and schools at the very beginning … in preschool. Tunette Powell is a writer in Omaha and mother to JJ and Joah. (17 minutes) _Tunette Powell_

Act Two
About 20 years ago, a group of educators launched one of the biggest recent experiments in 
American education when they started creating charter schools designed for poor, minority kids.  
The idea was to create classrooms that are rigorous and strict.  We talk with a student named 
Rousseau Mieze, who grew up in a school like that and then became a teacher. (10 minutes)

Act Three
We spend a semester in a public school in New York City called Lyons Community School . Lyons is trying to avoid suspensions, detentions and basically all other forms of traditional punishment. (21 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt_

      <description>Most of us go from day to day just coasting on the status quo. If it ain’t broke, why fix it—right?

Act One
This next story is about a couple in a relationship that’s unlike the homes either of them grew up in. They’re married. And it’s a prison marriage. They met when the guy in the marriage was 
incarcerated. Reporter Christopher Rhoads tells the story. (19 minutes) _Christopher Rhoads_

Act Two

Nancy Updike saw the film and has this story. (4 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

      <description>As New Year’s approaches and people are contemplating things they want to change about themselves, we have stories of people trying to wake themselves up, shake up their own lives, or wake up others. Including the story of a company – or maybe it's a movement – called WakeUpNow.

Prologue
This American Life staffers Brian Reed and Bianca Giaever explain to Ira this thing they've found online called WakeUpNow . It's a company but they can't tell exactly what it does, and what its product is. Maybe it's a club? An organization? They find hundreds of enthusiastic videos people have made about it. (5 minutes)

Act One
Brian and Bianca go to a WakeUpNow conference to try to figure out what the company really is. WakeUpNow does something called "network marketing," which Brian points out, is a very bland term for something completely mind-blowing. The company's Marketing Director Jordan Harris tells Brian and Bianca that what they saw at the conference was not a good measure of what the company is. We also hear from Robert L. Fitzpatrick, who researches network marketing and wrote a book called False Profits ; and Damien Lacks, who quit his job to do WakeUpNow. (31 minutes)

Act Two
Jacob Goldstein and David Kestenbaum of NPR's Planet Money tell the story of two guys who decided that the CEO of a small tool company was paid too much and wanted to wake people up to that fact - They wanted to cut the CEO's pay. The two people happened to be investors in the tool company. It turns out if you think CEOs are paid too much, it's guys like this with money to invest in stocks that you want on your side. Planet Money is a production of NPR News. (15 minutes)

Act Three
A woman in Springfield Oregon named Angela Jane Evancie tries to get her boyfriend, sleepy grad student Morgan Peach, to wake up during finals week. This story was originally broadcast on December 12, 2012 . (3 minutes)

      <description>Can other people's expectations of you alter what you can do physically? Alix Spiegel and Lulu Miller of NPR's new radio show and podcastInvisibiliainvestigate that question – specifically, they look into something that sounds impossible: if people’s expectations can change whether a blind man can see.

Prologue
NPR Science reporters Alix Spiegel and Lulu Miller explain to Ira Glass how they smuggled 
a rat into NPR headquarters in Washington, and ran an unscientific version of a famous 
experiment first done by Psychology Professor Robert Rosenthal. It showed how people’s 
thoughts about rats could affect their behavior. Another scientist, Carol Dweck, explains that 
it’s true for people too: expectations affect students, children, soldiers, in measurable ways. (6 minutes) _Lulu Miller, Alix Spiegel_

Act One
Lulu tells the story of Daniel Kish, who’s blind, but can navigate the world by clicking with his tongue. This gives him so much information about what’s around him, he does all sorts of things most blind people don’t. Most famously, he rides a bike. We learn why he was raised so differently from the way most blind kids are brought up, and how the book The Making of Blind Men by Robert Scott changes everything for him. (25 minutes) _Lulu Miller, Alix Spiegel_

Act Two
Daniel Kish says that through clicking, he forms mental pictures. He actually sees. A neuroscientist Lore Thaler explains how that might be possible. Daniel goes on a mission to teach other blind people to see the way he does. (23 minutes) _Lulu Miller, Alix Spiegel_

But that same anonymity makes it possible for people to say all the awful things that make the Internet such an annoying and sometimes frightening place. This week: what happens when the Internet turns on you?

Prologue
Ira finds a ridiculous comment thread on the Internet about an optical illusion . (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Writer Lindy West has been harassed by hundreds of trolls online. But only one ever apologized for his remarks. Lindy began to wonder, could he explain why trolls choose to be so cruel? (21 minutes) _Lindy West_

Act Two
Recently, This American Life has been getting a lot of hate mail about the young women on our staff — listeners complain about their "vocal fry." Ira investigates the phenomenon.

Act Three
Jeffrey Brodeur worked at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and was put in charge of an Osprey Cam — a live web feed of an osprey nest near his office. Which he thought was just charming — until the mother osprey in the nest began acting strangely. (14 minutes) _Jonathan Menjivar_

Act Four
This story, produced by the podcast Reply All ( website , iTunes ), asks the question — can internet bile ever be helpful? PJ Vogt interviews Paul Ford, a man who programmed a website to deal with his anxiety. The website sends him abusive comments all day long. (6 1/2 minutes) _PJ Vogt_

      <description>This American Lifehost Ira Glass was never into William Burroughs. Didn't get why people love his writing so much. Then he heard this radio story that changed all that, partly because it wasn't very reverential about Burroughs. For Burroughs 101st birthday, we hear that story.

Prologue
Ira talks about the fact that he never much liked William Burroughs or his writing, just never got 
why Burroughs was this revered figure for some people. Then Ira heard a recent BBC documentary 
about Burroughs and finally understood. Ira says he's going to play the whole documentary on the 
show in honor of what would have been Burroughs 101st birthday this week. (2 minutes)

Act One
Iggy Pop, the documentary's narrator, begins by listing some of the artists and artistic movements 
influenced by Burroughs: Bob Dylan, The Beatles, Steely Dan, Kurt Cobain, Lou Reed; punk, heavy 
metal. We hear from director John Waters on the impact on him of Burroughs' open homosexuality 
and frankness about sex. Others talk about Burroughs' heroin addiction and obsession with guns 
and weapons. Burroughs shot his wife to death in what he said was a terrible accident. (35 minutes)

Act Two
Iggy Pop picks up the story of Burroughs by explaining "Cut Up" — Burroughs habit of randomly jumbling, repeating and re-assembling words and phrases in his writing. David Bowie and others picked it up. We hear about Burroughs' privileged childhood in St. Louis and his lifelong critique of exactly the world of power and money he grew up in. There's archival footage of Burroughs and others reading his sci-fi stories, and finally Burroughs appearing on Saturday Night Live . (19 minutes)

      <description>This American Lifehost Ira Glass was never into William Burroughs. Didn't get why people love his writing so much. Then he heard this radio story that changed all that, partly because it wasn't very reverential about Burroughs. For Burroughs 101st birthday, we hear that story.

Prologue
Ira talks about the fact that he never much liked William Burroughs or his writing, just never got 
why Burroughs was this revered figure for some people. Then Ira heard a recent BBC documentary 
about Burroughs and finally understood. Ira says he's going to play the whole documentary on the 
show in honor of what would have been Burroughs 101st birthday this week. (2 minutes)

Act One
Iggy Pop, the documentary's narrator, begins by listing some of the artists and artistic movements 
influenced by Burroughs: Bob Dylan, The Beatles, Steely Dan, Kurt Cobain, Lou Reed; punk, heavy 
metal. We hear from director John Waters on the impact on him of Burroughs' open homosexuality 
and frankness about sex. Others talk about Burroughs' heroin addiction and obsession with guns 
and weapons. Burroughs shot his wife to death in what he said was a terrible accident. (35 minutes)

Act Two
Iggy Pop picks up the story of Burroughs by explaining "Cut Up" — Burroughs habit of randomly jumbling, repeating and re-assembling words and phrases in his writing. David Bowie and others picked it up. We hear about Burroughs' privileged childhood in St. Louis and his lifelong critique of exactly the world of power and money he grew up in. There's archival footage of Burroughs and others reading his sci-fi stories, and finally Burroughs appearing on Saturday Night Live . (19 minutes)

      <description>There are so many cops who look at the killing of Eric Garner or Mike Brown and say race didn't play a factor. And there are tons of black people who say that's insane. There's a division between people who distrust the police — even fear them — and people who see cops as a force for good. Stories of people living on both sides of that divide, and people trying to bridge it.

Prologue
Ira tells the story of Lisa Mahone, who was pulled over by a police officer who she says was acting really weird. When he pulled a gun on her, Lisa decided to call 911 — on the cop. WBEZ has been covering this story since it happened in the fall. Here's their original story from October 2014 . (7 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
In 2008, the Milwaukee Police Department, which has a long history of tension with black residents, got a new chief named Ed Flynn. One of his big goals when he came to the city was to try and improve the relationship between cops and black Milwaukeeans. Producer Brian Reed shadows some Milwaukee officers, to see what the department is trying. Brian also tells the story of Derek Williams, who died in police custody, and asks Chief Flynn why his officers ignored Williams even though he kept saying, "I can't breathe." (20 minutes) _Brian Reed_

Act Two
Brian continues his story. Chief Flynn implements Milwaukee's version of stop and frisk, but some officers start illegally searching residents. An officer shoots and kills a black man in a park across from City Hall. And tensions erupt at a monthly Fire and Police Commission Meeting. Plus, Brian tags along as officers try to solve a shooting case. (31 minutes) _Brian Reed_

      <description>Our second hour ofstories about policing and race. We hear about one city where relations between police and black residents went terribly, and another city where they seem to be improving remarkably. And one of our producers asks: Why aren't police chiefs talking about race after incidents where unarmed black men are wrongly killed by officers?

Prologue
This American Life producer Robyn Semien watched the Eric Garner video with a friend who's a
New York cop. Robyn's black. Her friend's white. Robyn says she'd assumed they'd at least find
some common ground in how they view the video. They find none.  (5 1/2 minutes) _Robyn Semien_

Act One
Miki Meek reports on how bad things got for black residents of Miami Gardens, Florida – and why they got so bad – by telling the story of two men, a convenience store owner and one of his employees. Fusion : " Florida city’s ‘stop and frisk’ nabs thousands of kids " Miami Herald : " In Miami Gardens, store video catches cops in the act " (29 minutes) _Miki Meek_

Act Two
FBI Director James Comey gave a speech this week calling for law enforcement to redouble its
efforts to serve the black community, and calling for a conversation about race in policing.  
Producer Robyn Semien has noticed that local big city police chiefs do not think race is a factor
in the newsmaking incidents where white officers kill unarmed black men. She and Sean Cole 
visit a police department that's doing a good job fixing the problem of cops killing black men:
the Las Vegas PD. (21 minutes) _Sean Cole, Robyn Semien_

      <description>People caught in limbo, using ingenuity and guile to try to get themselves out.

Prologue
Rachel has two kids. Elias, age seven, is a vegetarian. Theo, age five, is not. But Elias wants Theo, and everyone else in the house, to be vegetarian too. So Rachel and her husband are in the middle of negotiating the desires of two very strong willed kids. (12 minutes) _Ira Glass, Jyllian Gunther_

Act One
Sara Corbett 's father-in-law Dick is 81. And he's become obsessed with a limbo most of us hate – the music he hears whenever he's on hold. Sara is co-author of the book A House in the Sky . The hold music, Opus No. 1, was composed by Tim Carleton and Darrick Deel. It's available on YouTube , Spotify , and Amazon . (14 minutes) _Sara Corbett_

Act Two
Mark Oppenheimer reports on agunah in the Orthodox Jewish community. An agunah is a woman whose husband refuses to give her a divorce – in Hebrew it means "chained wife." If you're an Orthodox Jew, strictly following Jewish law, the only real way to get divorced is if your husband agrees to hand you a piece of paper called a get. Without the get, women who want out of their marriages can stay chained to their husbands for years. In New York, a couple of rabbis were recently accused of using violence to force men to give their wives a get. Mark’s latest book is Squirrel Hill: The Tree of Life Synagogue Shooting and the Soul of a Neighborhood . (17 minutes) _Mark Oppenheimer_

Act Three
Brett Martin documents a previously unnoticed human phenomenon, one that involves airplanes, crying, and Reese Witherspoon. Brett is the author of the book Difficult Men . (11 minutes) _Brett Martin_

      <description>It’s rare for people to change what they believe, and if they do it, it’s usually a long process. This week, stories of those very infrequent instances where people’s opinions flip on fundamental things that they believe. Why does it happen in these particular and unusual circumstances? We explain. NOTE: One of the authors of a study covered in this episode has asked that the study beretracted.

Prologue
Ira introduces “the backfire effect,” a phenomenon stating that when confronted with evidence disproving what we believe, most of us ignore that evidence, dig in and become more entrenched in our beliefs. Which just makes the recordings he plays more surprising—recordings of canvassers going door to door and effectively convincing people to completely flip their positions. (5 1/2 minutes)

Act One
Ira continues to explain how these canvassers learned how to change people’s minds, and talks about the mistakes they made along the way. (18 minutes)

Act Two
Reporter Joe Richman visits a program in Richmond, CA that is trying a controversial method of reducing gun violence in their city: paying criminals to not commit crimes. Sounds crazy, but the even crazier part is…it works. To figure out how, Joe speaks to guys participating in the program, and to Sam Vaughn, a man whose job it is to monitor the criminals' progress and keep them on track. Joe runs the Radio Diaries podcast, where this week you can hear a companion story . (19 minutes) _Joe Richman_

Act Three
Zalena (pictured, right) lived in paradise. She grew up in American Samoa, hanging out on the beach, doing normal teenage things with her friends—until senior year, when her dad decided he was going to move the family to the exact opposite of everything she’d known—a tiny, isolated town in Alaska. (14 minutes) _Miki Meek_

      <description>People who are tied together, but imagine radically different futures.

Prologue
In order to maintain their status as the friendliest, calmest people on the plane, flight attendants bicker mercilessly behind our backs.  Then they cuddle up and sleep right next to each other in the same bed. (4 minutes)

Act One
Kim Jong-Il loved movies – but hated all the movies made in North Korea.  So he kidnapped a famous South Korean director and his ex-wife, a South Korean film star, locked them up in a villa in North Korea, and forced them to make movies for him.  Nancy Updike tells the story. (21 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Two
Lots of people in America share actual beds – but almost never see each other. Flight attendants have crash pads near airports, oil rig workers carry their own sheets and sleep in shifts in an RV – and Stephanie Foo has a profile of Mexican immigrants who share a few beds in a tiny trailer in upstate New York. (6 1/2 minutes) _Stephanie Foo_

Act Three
When someone stole Jessamyn Lovell’s ID, she became obsessed with the thief. Miki Meek tells what happened. (19 minutes) _Miki Meek_

Act Four
Several people who just woke up on red-eye flights talk about their dreams. (3 minutes)

      <description>Some information is so big and so complicated that it seems impossible to talk to kids about. This week, stories about the vague and not-so-vague ways we teach children about race, death, and sex.

Prologue
This American Life producer Chana Joffe-Walt sits in for Ira Glass, because Chana has kids, two young sons. And her oldest, Jacob, has some complicated ideas about people, that Chana wants to straighten out, but doesn’t know exactly how. (4 1/2 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt_

Act One
Workshops on sexual assault and consent are hugely popular on college campuses around the country. Chana visits one of these workshops to find out what’s being taught, and more importantly, what college boys in particular have already learned about sex, back when they were kids. (13 1/2 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt_

Act Two
Comedian W. Kamau Bell has two daughters, and tries to figure out just how much about the violent history of racism and oppression his four-year-old can handle. W. Kamau Bell hosts the CNN show United Shades of America . (22 minutes) _W. Kamau Bell_

Act Three
While it’s hard to explain to kids how babies come into the world, it might be harder to explain that people leave the world too — especially to a kid whose mom or dad or brother or sister has died. There are grief counseling centers all over the U.S. that cater specifically to children. Reporter Jonathan Goldstein visited one in Salt Lake City.  Jonathan is the host of Heavyweight from Gimlet Media. (22 minutes) _Jonathan Goldstein_

      <description>Blair Braverman was a dog musher on an Alaskan glacier. One day the weather turned rough, and she and a pack of tourists were stuck. The worst part? They had to pretend like nothing was wrong. This and other stories of people facing very difficult situations who put their game face on and muscle through. And, we hear from people whose faces betray them and prominently display all their anxiety.

Prologue
Ira explores the news this week alleging bribery and corruption among officials for international soccer's governing board, FIFA. There have been 14 people arrested, and law enforcement officials have made clear that their investigation is not finished. One official who has not been indicted, FIFA president Sepp Blatter, has kept a remarkable game face in press conferences throughout the week. (3 1/2 minutes)

Act One
For two summers when she was 18 and 19, Blair Braverman worked as a dogsled guide on an Alaskan glacier. 8 times a day, helicopters full of tourists would arrive on the glacier for their experience of Real Alaska. Then one day, the weather turned bad and things got a little too real. Blair's most recent book is Welcome to the Goddamn Ice Cube . (16 minutes) _Blair Braverman_

Act Two
Comedian Tig Notaro tells the story about the time she played a string of dates night after night after night in Las Vegas – and bombed every single time. Getting up on stage and pretending like everything was going great was not easy. The story is part of the material she's working up for her first HBO comedy special "Tig Notaro: Boyish Girl Interrupted" which airs Saturday, August 22nd exclusively on HBO. (7 minutes) _Tig Notaro_

Act Three
Ira speaks with Mike Pesca, host of the sports podcast Hang Up and Listen and Slate's daily podcast The Gist about the whole concept of the game face in sports. What is it exactly? And who might be the best examples of athletes with incredible game faces? Then Ira speaks with writer David Dupuis about the athlete who may have the game face-iest game face in sports history – hockey goalie Terry Sawchuk. Dupuis wrote a biography of Sawchuk titled, " Sawchuk: The Troubles and Triumphs of the World's Greatest Goalie ." (8 minutes) _Mike Pesca_

Act Four
It turns out that one of the members of the This American Life staff, Elna Baker, has a kind of anti-game face. She's what's called a chronic blusher. And recently, she's been wondering whether she should get a type of surgery this could solve this problem that's plaguing her. Producer Sean Cole decided to look into the surgery for her, to see whether the it would give Elna the game face she's always wanted. (18 minutes) _Elna Baker, Sean Cole_

      <description>A captain’s log is a simple thing: the date, the time, maybe the weather — and the current status of a long journey. You wouldn’t know from the cryptic notations what weird worlds lurk beneath. On this week's show, stories behind those cryptic notations — including a concentration camp in China that housed groups of Girl Scouts. Also, Aziz Ansari explains the significance of a Thanksgiving text message, and Etgar Keret destroys a marriage piece by piece.

Prologue
Erik Larson has read lots of captain’s logs while researching big historical events.  When he found the log of Captain Walther Schwieger, the guy who headed the U-boat that sank the Lusitania, he knew something didn’t sound right. (7 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
PJ Vogt’s friend plays a trick on some girl scouts. The trick doesn’t work. The girl scouts don’t realize they’re being pranked. And in trying to figure out why, PJ comes across a logbook that tells him a secret history about the power of the girl scouts’ unrelenting cheerfulness. PJ co-hosts the podcast Reply All . (21 1/2 minutes) _PJ Vogt_

Act Two
Comedian Aziz Ansari has been touring the country collecting people’s text messages from when they first say hi, and ask each other out. Sociologist Eric Klinenberg wanted to study this raw data of the initial approach a man makes to a woman over text. So the two of them did a focus group at a comedy club in New York. Jonathan Menjivar tells what happened. Aziz and Eric co-wrote a book called Modern Romance . (12 1/2 minutes) _Aziz Ansari, Jonathan Menjivar_

Act Three
We bring you this very matter-of-fact article from 1853, about something profoundly troubling: a 
slave auction in Virginia. (12 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Four
Actress Sue Scott reads a short story by Etgar Keret. Etgar's newest book is a memoir called The Seven Good Years . This story didn't fit on the radio. It's only in the Internet version of the episode. (5 minutes) _Etgar Keret_

      <description>A story about someone who's desperately trying – against long odds – to make it to the United States and become an American. Abdi is a Somali refugee living in Kenya and gets the luckiest break of his life: he wins a lottery that puts him on a short list for a U.S. visa. This is his ticket out. But before he can cash in his golden ticket, the police start raiding his neighborhood, targeting refugees.

Prologue
Ira talks to cyber cafe workers around the world about something that lots of Americans have never heard of, but that people in other countries know all about: a lottery run by the U.S. government where the prize is a visa to come to America. Each year people flock to cyber cafes to enter it, hoping for a lucky break that will change their life. In 2014, one of the lottery winners was Abdi Nor, whose story today's show is about. (10 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
It turns out winning the lottery is only the first step in trying to come to America. More than half of the people who win each year never make it. Abdi is living in Nairobi, Kenya, when he wins, and as he's trying to prepare for his interview at the U.S. Embassy, Kenyan police start relentlessly raiding his neighborhood, rounding up Somalis and taking them away. So Abdi goes into hiding in his apartment. Leo Hornak spoke to Abdi almost every night while this was happening, to find out if Abdi would evade the police and make it to America. Abdi has a memoir out on Tuesday called " Call Me American ." (17 minutes) _Leo Hornak_

Act Two
Leo Hornak's story about Abdi continues. Abdi encounters one obstacle after another on the streets of Nairobi. And finally, the moment of truth comes: his embassy interview. A version of Leo's story first aired on the BBC show Crossing Continents . (31 minutes)

      <description>A car plant in Fremont California that might have saved the U.S. car industry. In 1984, General Motors and Toyota opened NUMMI as a joint venture. Toyota showed GM the secrets of its production system: How it made cars of much higher quality and much lower cost than GM achieved. Frank Langfitt explains why GM didn't learn the lessons—until it was too late.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass introduces the story of the New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., aka NUMMI. In 1984, General Motors and Toyota opened NUMMI as a joint venture. Toyota showed GM the secrets of its production system: How it made cars of much higher quality and much lower cost than GM achieved. But today, GM cars still don't have the quality of Japanese imports. GM went bankrupt. And in 2010 NUMMI was closed, sending thousands of car workers looking for jobs. In this hour-long story, which we reported in 2010 , NPR Automotive Correspondent Frank Langfitt tells the story of NUMMI and why GM—and the rest of the American car business—wasn't able to learn from it more quickly. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
The rise of NUMMI, or how one of the worst auto plants in America started producing some of its best cars, thanks to lessons learned from the Toyota production system. (25 1/2 minutes) _Frank Langfitt_

Act Two
Why did it take so many years for GM to begin implementing the lessons of NUMMI across the company? NPR Automotive Correspondent Frank Langfitt continues his story. (26 minutes) _Frank Langfitt_

      <description>Right now, all sorts of people are trying to rethink and reinvent education, to get poor minority kids performing as well as white kids. But there's one thing nobody tries anymore, despite lots of evidence that it works: desegregation. Nikole Hannah-Jones looks at a district that, not long ago, accidentally launched a desegregation program.

Prologue
Ira speaks with New York Times Magazine Reporter Nikole Hannah-Jones about her years reporting 
on education and the various kinds of school reforms administrators have tried to close the achievement
gap that never seem to work. Nikole says there's one reform that people have pretty much given up
on, despite a lot of evidence that it works – school integration. (11 minutes) _Nikole Hannah-Jones_

Act One
Nikole Hannah-Jones reports on a school district that accidentally stumbled on an integration program
in recent years. It's the Normandy School District in Normandy, Missouri. Normandy is on the border of
Ferguson, Missouri, and the district includes the high school that Michael Brown attended. (30 minutes) _Nikole Hannah-Jones_

Act Two
Nikole Hannah-Jones' story on the Normandy school district from the first part of the show continues. Nikole also wrote about Normandy for ProPublica , and she wrote an incredibly memorable story about choosing a school for her own daughter for The New York Times . And Elisa Crouch's article in St Louis Dispatch that documented the day in the life of one Normandy senior is here . (14 minutes) _Nikole Hannah-Jones_

      <description>Last week we looked at a school district integrating by accident. This week: a city going all out to integrate its schools. Plus, a girl who comes up with her own one-woman integration plan.

Prologue
Chana Joffe-Walt talks to Kiana, who went to a school that was overwhelmingly black and Latino, 
but when some white students showed up one day on an exchange program, she went up to them 
eagerly.  And since then, has embarked on a one-woman school integration program.  Among other 
things, she wanted to see “white wasted.” (9 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt_

Act One
Chana Joffe-Walt reports on the Hartford, CT school system, which actively seeks to integrate.  The 
results have been impressive.  It used to be that 11% of Hartford students were in integrated schools.
Now it’s nearly half.  But the trick to the whole thing is: convince white families it’s in their self-
interest to go to integrated schools.  This requires the kind of marketing skills and savvy we’re more
used to seeing at Apple and Pepsi than we are at a public school district. There's a book by Susan Eaton about Hartford's integration plan, called The Children in Room E4 . (38 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt_

Act Two
Reporter Nikole Hannah-Jones, who has investigated integration in schools for years, joins Chana
Joffe-Walt to interview the Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan. The Obama Administration says
it’s in favor of integrating the schools, but doesn’t seem to do so much to promote it.  They seemed
to have the perfect opportunity, integration advocates say, with their Race to the Top program.  But
even then they didn’t act.  Nikole and Chana ask: what’s the deal? (8 minutes) _Nikole Hannah-Jones, Chana Joffe-Walt_

      <description>It can be hard to know the right moment for something to happen.

Prologue
When Jordan was going into his senior year of high school in small town Utah, he and his buddies all lived together in a house, daring each other into Jackass-style pranks and stunts. There's one particular thing Jordan did that he did not want to talk to Ira about. (10 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Harmon Leon is a writer and comedian whose cocktail party story about “the-weirdest-gig-I-ever-did” is more weird—by a lot—than anyone else’s we’ve heard. He answered an ad several years ago that called for a hilarious sidekick to a celebrity on a hidden camera show. Harmon runs the storytelling series Tale. More on O.J. Simpson's short-lived prank show . (30 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Two
One of the show's producers, Zoe Chace, tells Ira about a joke she made pretty soon after 
something terrible had happened. And then Ira talks to Amy Silverman about something else being too soon, and how she finally figured

      <description>It can be hard to know the right moment for something to happen.

Prologue
When Jordan was going into his senior year of high school in small town Utah, he and his buddies all lived together in a house, daring each other into Jackass-style pranks and stunts. There's one particular thing Jordan did that he did not want to talk to Ira about. (10 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Harmon Leon is a writer and comedian whose cocktail party story about “the-weirdest-gig-I-ever-did” is more weird—by a lot—than anyone else’s we’ve heard. He answered an ad several years ago that called for a hilarious sidekick to a celebrity on a hidden camera show. Harmon runs the storytelling series Tale. More on O.J. Simpson's short-lived prank show . (30 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Two
One of the show's producers, Zoe Chace, tells Ira about a joke she made pretty soon after 
something terrible had happened. And then Ira talks to Amy Silverman about something else being too soon, and how she finally figured 
out the right moment for it. Amy's blog about her daughter is at girlinapartyhat.com . (15 minutes) _Zoe Chace_

      <description>Katrina bus tours go all over New Orleans, but it’s illegal for them to go into the Lower 9th Ward, the area that's been the slowest to rebuild. This week we go around talking to residents there about what matters the most to them (and what doesn't) ten years after the hurricane. The episode we did in 2005 the week of the storm ishere.

Prologue
Residents of the Lower 9th Ward in New Orleans felt so strongly against hurricane tours after the storm, that legislation made the bus tours illegal there. Ira Glass talks to residents about the problem with bus tours, and takes us on a walking tour of the area, to meet people who are there now, 10 years after the storm. (7 minutes)

Act 1
Robyn Semien talks to St. Claude Internet Café owner Kirk Washington about what’s changed the most in his life, post-Katrina. She finds out it’s literally everything, every minute, every day. (11 minutes) _Robyn Semien_

Act 2
Zoe Chace goes to a favorite bar of the Lower 9th Ward: Mercede’s Place. She finds people who want so badly to go back to their lives before the storm, but know they can’t. (9 minutes) _Zoe Chace_

Act 3
Lots of people in the lower 9th ward believe that the levees were exploded by the US government, and that’s why their neighborhood ended up under water. This makes a lot of sense when you learn about what happened in that same place in 1927. (6 minutes)

Act 4
A lot of people lost their homes during Katrina, but a lot of people lost their homes afterward, too—in ten years of post-storm debt, foreclosures, and hard loans. Zoe Chace talked with Roy Bradley, a Saints fan who’s facing losing his house right after he rebuilt it. (11 minutes) _Zoe Chace_

Act 5
Someone has moved into Kirk Washington’s friend’s house—the guy from the first stop, whose friend died during Katrina. Her name is Sarah. Producer Sean Cole talked to her about what it’s like to move to a neighborhood, and into a house, that lost so much during the storm. (11 minutes)

Act 6
Lots of people don’t remember the storm: like people who are just becoming adolescents today.   
But they think about it a lot.  We meet a couple kids in this situation, and then find one kid in 
particular, looking for his best friend.  Then we find the best friend. And they talk, for the first time 
in ten years. (9 minutes)

      <description>Gladiators in the Colosseum. Sideshow performers. Reality television. We've always loved to gawk at the misery or majesty of others. But this week, we ask the question: What's it like when the tables are turned and all eyes are on you?

Prologue
Ira talks to Joel Gold, a psychologist and author, about a strangely common delusion known as the "Truman Show Delusion," in which patients believe that they are being filmed, 24/7, for a national reality television program. (6 minutes)

Act One
Producer Stephanie Foo speaks to Nasubi, a Japanese comedian who, in the 90s, just wanted a little bit of fame. So he was thrilled when he won an opportunity to have his own segment on a Japanese reality TV show . Until he found out the premise: he had to sit in an empty apartment with no food, clothes or contact with the outside world, enter sweepstakes from magazines… and hope that he won enough sustenance to survive. The Contestant is a new documentary based on this story, coming to Hulu on May 2. (23 minutes) _Stephanie Foo_

Act Two
Writer Ariel Sabar tells the story of Roger Barker, a psychologist who believed humans should be studied outside the lab. So Barker dispatched an army of graduate students to follow the children of Oskaloosa, Kansas, and write down every single thing they did. Sabar wrote a book about Roger Barker called " The Outsider ." (8 minutes) _Ariel Sabar_

Act Three
Charlie Brill and Mitzi McCall were a comedy duo back in the mid-1960s, playing clubs around Los Angeles, when their agent called to tell them he'd landed them the gig of a lifetime: They were going to be on The Ed Sullivan Show. The only problem was that their performance was a total fiasco, for a bunch of reasons, including one they never saw coming. David Segal reports. (17 minutes) _David Segal_

      <description>This week we go into the room at the headquarters of fast food chain Hardee's with the people who decided that this burger with beef, hot dogs, and chips is what America should be eating. We'll hear the story of how they sold that burger and other instances where how you tell the story is more important than the literal facts.

Prologue
Ira talks about the phenomenon of weird food mashups that fast food companies started selling in the last five years – things like the pizza with hot dogs on the crust that Pizza Hut made or the Hardee's burger with a cheesesteak as the topping on the burger. Ira explains that there is something about these foods that he's been wondering about. There must be a group of people who pitch ideas for new foods and then decide which ones they're actually going to make. What is like to be in that room? (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Producer Zoe Chace gets into the room that Ira has been wondering about. Specifically, the headquarters of fast food chain Hardee's. They've whittled down a list of hundreds of ideas to a dozen sandwiches that they've made and are trying out. Zoe explains how they decide which ones are actually going to make it to market. _Zoe Chace_

Act Two
Writer and musician Ahamefule Oluo has been puzzling out one story for a lot of his life. It's the story of a stranger, who also, is his dad. (23 minutes) _Ahamefule Oluo_

Act Three
As we were putting together this week's show, we thought back to the guy in Act One who was in charge of marketing when Jack in the Box went through an E. Coli crisis. Because there's another company, Volkswagen, who's dealing with a huge PR crisis. And we wondered, what should the next VW ad be? What could they possibly say to make people trust them again? (13 minutes) _Zoe Chace_

      <description>Twenty years ago, the prime minister of Israel was assassinated. The killer was a lone gunman, Israeli and Jewish, just like the prime minister. Lots of witnesses saw it happen; the assassin confessed immediately, that night, and has never recanted. But today, oddly, lots of people don’t believe it happened that way. And a question hangs over the country: did this act change the fate of the nation?

Prologue
Ira talks to producer Nancy Updike and reporter Dan Ephron, about their interview with the accomplice, Hagai Amir, who showed them the house where he and his brother plotted the murder and the shed where he machined special bullets. Israelis on the street tell Updike and Ephron they don’t believe the Hagai and Yigal Amir did it. _Dan Ephron, Nancy Updike_

Act One
Updike and Ephron reconstruct the night of the murder, with Ephron describing what he recalls (he reported from Israel at the time and covered the rally where Rabin was assassinated). A police investigator talks about interrogating Amir in the hours after the assassination. The shooter confessed immediately, describing how he killed Rabin to stop peace deals with the Palestinians. The pathologist who performed Rabin’s autopsy says it was a clear cut case, nothing unusual. And then Hillel Weiss, a right-wing activist, lays out his conspiracy theory: Rabin staged an attempt on his own life in order to boost his public standing and smear his opponents on the right. It was supposed to be a thwarted assassination attempt but something went wrong and he died in the process. _Dan Ephron, Nancy Updike_

Act Two
Ephron takes the shirt Rabin was wearing on the night of the assassination from Israel to the U.S. to have it examined by a gunshot expert. A right-wing activist describes what the assassination meant to her and her settler movement -- a political victory. Hagai, the accomplice, argues with his mother over the details of the murder, and it becomes clear that even she believes in the conspiracy theories. _Dan Ephron_

      <description>Emily Dickinson said “The heart wants what it wants.” This week stories from people who take that notion to extremes, and are unapologetic about it.

Prologue
Ira talks to a man in his 70s who’s about to travel across the country to tell a woman he loves how he really feels, despite some very real signs that doing so might be a bad idea. (8 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Jesse had been waiting his whole life to fall in love—and then he started getting these letters from the perfect woman, Pamala. She seemed vulnerable. In need of protection. A classic beauty. He was totally devoted. They corresponded for years. And when something happens that really should change how he feels about her— he just can’t give it up. NPR’s social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam reports the story. He hosts the podcast Hidden Brain . (31 minutes) _Shankar Vedantam_

Act Two
Comedian Elsa Waithe tells about going to Time’s Square to take part in the Black Lives Matter protests, and winding up with a huge crush on her arresting officer. (9 minutes) _Elsa Waithe_

Act Three
Julia Lillis talks to Ira about the huge, romantic move she made after a break up, and how it was both crazy and worth doing. (6 minutes)

      <description>People deciding to make very big changes.

Prologue
Bob Carlson and his 10-year-old daughter, Tess, were driving by Six Flags Magic Mountain when she told him about one of her biggest fears: roller coasters. So they decided to try and take one on. This story is excerpted from the KCRW show Unfictional . (3 minutes) _Bob Carlson, Ira Glass_

Act One
Anthony DeVito recently observed his grandmother go through a metamorphosis no one in the family ever imagined they'd see. (17 1/2 minutes) _Anthony DeVito_

Act Two
Most big grand transformations we go through really come down to a hundred little things that we change about ourselves. This recently happened for a refugee from Afghanistan, now living in Detroit. She rode the bus for the first time and took Ira along. (8 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
There are things lots of us think we might fix about ourselves, you know, someday. When we get around to it. When things calm down around here for a minute. And then for some of us, that day arrives and we try to rise to the occasion. Keith O'Brien met a guy like that at a prison. (12 minutes) _Keith O'Brien_

Act Four
It's not just that deciding to change your life completely can be momentous. Telling people about the decision can be a big deal too. Andrew Greer talked to producer Sean Cole about an unexpected reaction to something he told his parents when he was a teenager. Andy is the author of " The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells ." (12 1/2 minutes) _Sean Cole_

      <description>For Frank Sinatra's 100th Birthday: stories, tributes, and attempts to understand the Chairman of the Board.An updated version of an episode originally broadcast back in 1997.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass, with a recording of a 1962 Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy 
Davis Jr., appearance at the Villa Venice, a club outside Chicago. What's fascinating 
about Sinatra is how he is so many different people at once, and they're all on display 
in this recording: sentimental crooner, cruel woman-baiter, bully, goofball. Writer Rennie 
Sparks makes the case that Sinatra is mesmerizing because he's every man, every 
possible man, all rolled into one. (8 minutes) _Ira Glass, Rennie Sparks_

Act One
Gay Talese reads from his classic 1966 Esquire article , in which he followed around Sinatra at the height of Sinatra's power. (10 minutes) _Gay Talese_

Act Two
Before Sinatra died, Sarah Vowell appeared on this radio program and made a prediction about how network news would cover Sinatra's death ... and she made a simple plea. We hear whether her prediction came true. This essay appears in Sarah's book, Take the Cannoli: Stories from the New World . (9 minutes) _Sarah Vowell_

Act Three
Ira and music contributor John Conners on Sinatra's worst songs. And a brief history of 
what makes that 1950s Sinatra sound so great, with Will Friedwald, author of the 
definitive book on Sinatra's music, Sinatra! The Song Is You: A Singer's Art. (3 minutes) _John Connors, Ira Glass_

Act Four
Michael Ventura, who grew up Sicilian in New York, says that as a kid he thought Sinatra was in his family. His book The Death of Frank Sinatra is not really about Sinatra. It's about men like Ventura, who drew part of their style and sense of self from Frank. He reads from the only section in the book where Sinatra actually appears: an account of a Sinatra concert, circa 1994. He says he wanted to write about the older Sinatra because the older Sinatra contains all the ages of Sinatra. All of them come forward when he sings. (11 minutes) _Michael Ventura_

Act Five
An odd occurrence at 124 East Fourth Street in Manhattan's East Village. For the last five weeks, a singer named Nick Drakides has stood on the stoop singing Sinatra songs late at night to the delight of his neighbors. The cops don't bust them; the crowds behave. It's his gift to New York. Blake Eskin tells the story. (11 minutes) _Blake Eskin_

      <description>Sure, there's a crude message that propaganda is trying to get across. But like poetry, when you know how to read it, propaganda contains lots of more subtle messages that you might not see at first glance. This week: examples, big and small, from around the world.

Prologue
Ira talks to New York Times reporter Damien Cave, about a strange phenomenon he noticed in the pages of in-flight magazines. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
When Jon Mooallem went to see his six-year-old daughter in a musical at her after-school program, he didn't know what to expect. But it certainly was not the performance saw. The musical was created by Children's After School Arts . (15 minutes) _Jon Mooallem_

Act Three
On September 29th a medical researcher in Philadelphia fired off a simple, well-meaning tweet, and then barely thought twice about it. Little did she know that by doing that, she was perpetrating covert propaganda on behalf of the U.S. government. Ira explains. (7 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Four
Evan Osnos, a staff writer for the New Yorker who for years reported on China, tells producer Nancy Updike about an incredibly shrewd and successful propaganda campaign that hinged on two words. Evan's book about China, Age of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth, and Faith in the New China, won the national book award in 2014. (12 1/2 minutes) _Evan Osnos, Nancy Updike_

      <description>We human beings think we run the world, that we’ve got things under control. Then an animal shows up, and things don’t go as planned. This week, seals, wolves, and a moose drop in and show us who isn't boss.

Prologue

Act One
Even when an animal is not a pest, not chewing up homes or spreading disease or biting average citizens, even when it is universally loved, it can still wreak havoc when it arrives in our world. James Spring has this example from a community of harbor seals in La Jolla, California, near San Diego. (28 minutes) _James Spring_

Act Two
Back in the day, generally when a wild animal showed up, we’d just kill it. Take this press release the federal government put out nearly a hundred years ago.

Act Three
In Anchorage, many people take pride in being able to co-exist side-by-side with wild animals. Jon Mooallem has the story of one animal that became a resident of the city in a way that few non-humans ever do. Jon’s latest book is " This is Chance! ” (14 minutes) _Jon Mooallem_

      <description>We human beings think we run the world, that we’ve got things under control. Then an animal shows up, and things don’t go as planned. This week, seals, wolves, and a moose drop in and show us who isn't boss.

Prologue
Ira visits an 83-year-old man named Dick Paterniti who’s been waging a long and lonely war against a woodpecker. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Even when an animal is not a pest, not chewing up homes or spreading disease or biting average citizens, even when it is universally loved, it can still wreak havoc when it arrives in our world. James Spring has this example from a community of harbor seals in La Jolla, California, near San Diego. (28 minutes) _James Spring_

Act Two
Back in the day, generally when a wild animal showed up, we’d just kill it. Take this press release the federal government put out nearly a hundred years ago. They hired a trapper to take out the most successful animal outlaw that the range country ever knew. Read by actor Michael Chernus. (8 minutes) _Michael Chernus_

Act Three
In Anchorage, many people take pride in being able to co-exist side-by-side with wild animals. Jon Mooallem has the story of one animal that became a resident of the city in a way that few non-humans ever do. Jon’s latest book is " This is Chance! ” (14 minutes) _Jon Mooallem_

      <description>The way people talk about being fat is shifting. With one-third of Americans classified as overweight, and another third as obese, and almost none of us losing weight and keeping it off, maybe it’s time to rethink the way we see being fat. A show inspired by Lindy West’s bookShrill.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass interviews Lindy West about her experience “coming out” as fat. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass, Lindy West_

Act One
Lindy West tells us how she went from being ashamed of her fatness to embracing it, and reads from her book, Shrill . The book has been adapted into a TV show on Hulu , starring Aidy Bryant. (18 minutes) _Lindy West_

Act Two
Elna Baker lost a lot of weight, 110 pounds. When she was fat, she wasn’t able to get a job or a boyfriend and sometimes thought, “I wonder if it’s my weight.” She figured no, that’s a bad attitude, paranoia. When she lost the weight she discovered it was ALL because of her weight. A book Elna discusses in this story is Dietland by Sarai Walker. (19 minutes) _Elna Baker_

Act Three
Obesity in America affects a higher percentage of black people than white people. Roxane Gay talks about being black and being fat with host Ira Glass. Gay is the author of Bad Feminist . (5 minutes) _Roxane Gay, Ira Glass_

Act Four
Fat is seen by so many people as a kind of moral issue. They think you’re fat because you’re weak and can’t get control of your own life. One subset of that is the Christian weight loss movement. Reporter Daniel Engber tells the history of a particularly extreme moment in that movement. (13 minutes) _Daniel Engber_

Act Five
We close the show with one more excerpt from Lindy West’s book, Shrill . (2 minutes) _Lindy West_

      <description>Stories of people making the wrong choice, even though the right one is staring them squarely in the eye. Basketball players making a conscious decision to not do the thing that makes them better, pollsters refusing to see the truth of Donald Trump, and more.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass interviews author Alain de Botton about why so many of us choose the wrong spouses. Botton is the author of the new novel The Course of Love . (9 minutes) _Alain De Botton, Ira Glass_

Act One
Wilt Chamberlain - easily one of the best basketball players of all time - was a terrible free throw shooter. Except for one season when he changed technique and scored more free throws in one game than anyone ever has. Then, crazily, he gave up the technique. Malcolm Gladwell explains why we often make the wrong decisions, in full awareness that they're wrong. This story was adapted from Gladwell's new podcast Revisionist History , which is produced by Panoply . (28 minutes) _Malcolm Gladwell_

Act Two
Ira talks to Tom, who regrets his vote on Brexit this week. And Zoe Chace talks to Harry Enten , a senior analyst at the website FiveThirtyEight , about Donald Trump. When Trump announced his campaign for the presidency in June 2015, pundits dismissed him and pollsters said the numbers proved he'd never win the nomination. Only that's not at all what they showed! Trump was in the lead. Enten explains what they all missed. (13 minutes) _Zoe Chace, Harry Enten, Ira Glass_

Act Three
Comedian Kurt Braunohler makes a wrong choice, for his own amusement. (2 minutes) _Kurt Braunohler_

      <description>Stories of people trying to make sure they get what they paid for, from political change to bedroom slippers. We follow a donor as he vets presidential candidates, and go inside a company wrestling with the consequences of its "no questions asked,” lifetime return policy.

Prologue
Producer Zoe Chace takes a trip to the grocery store with Planet Money co-host – and ultimate bargain shopper – Jacob Goldstein . (5 ½ minutes) _Zoe Chace_

Reporter Sara Corbett looks into what happens when a company makes this promise: if you’re not 100% satisfied by our product, bring it back. Any time, for any reason; no questions asked. She finds a returns bin that says a lot more about the customers than the products. (20 ½ minutes) _Sara Corbett_

Act Three
Most stories of customer satisfaction are told by the customers. In this act, we ask: is the product satisfied by life with you? We get answers, from a product itself. Simon Rich reads his short story, “ Unprotected .” Please note: this story does vaguely acknowledge the existence of sex. Safe sex. (8 ½ minutes) _Simon Rich_

      <description>A bunch of us from our show went to refugee camps all over Greece. We found people falling in love, kids mad at their parents for dragging them to Europe, women doing their laundry in a baseball stadium locker room, and hundreds of people living at a gas station—sitting next to the pumps, smoking. Also: wild pigs. 57,000 refugees are stuck in Greece, making homes in some surprising locations. We hear what that’s really like. (Part Two)

Prologue
We were interested in how the Greek government was dealing with the refugees, but 
we also wanted to know what it was like for all these people who thought they were 
heading elsewhere in Europe who are now stuck in these camps, where they’re just 
waiting for some country to let them in and restart their lives.  Ira goes on a quick 
tour of camps around Greece. (6 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
One good place to see how this ad hoc response is working is at an abandoned baseball stadium in Athens. About a thousand Afghans are now living here. (11 1/2 minutes) _Miki Meek_

Act Two
Kids are everywhere in the camps, they’re a third of the refugees. You see them around, improvising stuff to play with. Ira talks to a woman named Aziza Bashar about what it’s like to be a parent in a camp. She has six children, the oldest 18, the youngest five. (16 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
The first step for refugees trying to get out of limbo in Greece has been calling (and calling) the asylum office… on Skype. (17.5 minutes) _Miki Meek_

      <description>Wereturn to Greecewith stories of people trying to move on with their lives in whatever way they can. We meet a couple who fell in love even though they weren't expecting anything like that to happen, and even though her family didn't approve. We also meet a shopkeeper in a camp who's running what amounts to a cigarette charity. (Part One)

Prologue
A couple guys show off a pretty creative invention. (2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
There are young single men and women at the camps, and there’s some flirting for sure. But usually it doesn’t seem to go very far. One of our producers Sean Cole met a couple camped out at a gas station. (14 1/2 minutes) _Sean Cole_

Act Two
People don’t have a lot of money in the refugee camps, and our producer Miki Meek went to see what that’s like at a camp that’s been built on the grounds of an abandoned psychiatric hospital. About 1,300 people are living there. They’re Yazidi, a religious minority from Iraq. (9 minutes) _Miki Meek_

Act Three
There’s a camp trying to set the gold standard for what refugee camps are to be. It’s in an actual beach vacation resort. Joanna Kakissis went there. (18 minutes) _Joanna Kakissis_

Act Four
One night at L-M Village, a panic-struck man walked up to Robyn Semien from our staff. He said his wife had a medical problem. (16 minutes) _Robyn Semien_

Act Five
Sean hit up this one piece of coverage that wasn’t like any of the others. He got a little obsessed with it. Follow refugees.tv on Facebook . (13 minutes) _Sean Cole_

      <description>What do you do when you're thrown into a situation you’re not prepared for? And while you’re flailing around—what happens to the people who depend on you? This week we present stories of people who find themselves in over their heads, including an attorney who knows little about criminal law assigned to defend a young man facing twenty years in prison.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks to Aaryn Zhou. When she was nine, her father threw her into the deep end of pool to teach her to swim. In this classic sink-or-swim scenario, she sank. (6 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
A lawyer with almost no experience in criminal law is assigned to a criminal case with a sentence of 20 years to life. This happened because, in Louisiana, like in a few states, public defenders’ offices are so short-staffed that courts are ordering private attorneys to take pro bono clients. Reporter David Zax tells the story. (29 minutes) _David Zax_

Act Two
Sometimes an entire government has to dive into the deep end of the pool and do something it’s never done before. One of our producers Karen Duffin has the story of the US government doing just that… in a high stakes sink or swim situation. Against a foe seeking global domination. Karen wrote a blog post elaborating on this story. (19 minutes) _Karen Duffin_

      <description>This week, stories about people trying their best to turn themselves into something else—like a badger. Or a professional comedian, in a language they didn’t grow up speaking.

Prologue
Charles Foster has always been obsessed with trying to figure out how animals see the world. So he decides to find out—by living life as a badger. His book about this is called Being a Beast . (8 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
French comedian Gad Elmaleh is known as the Jerry Seinfeld of France. He sells out arenas. Gets recognized on the street. But he’s deciding to give all of that up to try to make it big in America. In English, which he hasn’t totally mastered. And what’s funny in French, to French people, is not the same as what’s funny in English, to Americans. Zack McDermott tells the story. (28 minutes)

Act Two
Terriers have been bred for hundreds of years to kill rats. Ray Ray is a terrier, but he lives in a comfy apartment in New York City. His owner, Judy, isn’t sure about whether he still has his rat hunting instincts. So producers Zoe Chace and Emmanuel Dzotsi follow along as Ray goes on his first NYC rat hunt with the Ryders Alley Trencher-fed Society . (16 1/2 minutes) _Zoe Chace, Emmanuel Dzotsi_

      <description>Words can seem so puny and ineffective sometimes. On this show, we have stories in which ordinary people make last ditch efforts to get through to their loved ones, using a combination of small talk and not-so-small talk.

Prologue
Ira explains how at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the men with their finger to the button called their loved ones for what was potentially the last time. (2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Producer Miki Meek tells the story of a phone booth in Japan that attracts thousands of people who lost loved ones in the 2011 tsunami and earthquake. A Japanese TV crew from NHK Sendai filmed people inside the phone booth, whose phone is not connected to anything at all. (22 minutes) _Miki Meek_

Act Two
Jonathan Goldstein tries to convince his uncle and his father to get into the same room and have a conversation for the first time in decades, before it’s too late and one of them dies. This story comes from Jonathan’s podcast Heavyweight , from Gimlet Media. (33 minutes) _Jonathan Goldstein_

      <description>San Francisco’s Spider-Man burglar was remarkable. He dropped into buildings from skylights, leapt 10 feet from one roof to another. But mostly, his talent got him into trouble. This week, his story, and stories of other undesirable talents.

Prologue
Ira talks to Biba Struja – a Serbian man who says that when he was in high school, he discovered that he seemed to have a high resistance to electricity. It’s a power that he’s utilized, but is mostly a curse. Biba is the subject of the documentary Battery Man . (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Awhile back, San Francisco experienced a rash of burglaries that all fit a pattern. The suspect got into businesses at night through skylights, or the attic, and then lowered himself in with ropes where he would rob safes. The cops dubbed him Spider-Man. Our producer Karen Duffin would later find out that Spider-Man was someone she had a connection to. (24 minutes) _Karen Duffin_

Act Two
Zora Bikangaga grew up in a mostly white California suburb, the son of Ugandan immigrants. But when he went to college, someone thought he himself was Ugandan. So Zora did what felt right at the time. He ran with it. Zora spoke with producer Neil Drumming. (24 minutes) _Neil Drumming_

Act Three
Wendy Whelan was a principal dancer with the New York City Ballet until 2014. She explains an undesirable side of having an incredible talent. If you’re an athlete or dancer, you have to give it up while you’re still pretty young. This is an excerpt of a documentary called A Dancer Dies Twice , produced by Eleanor Mcdowall. It was originally a Falling Tree Production for BBC Radio Four. _Ira Glass_

      <description>Watching lies become the truth in this year's election. And a few people who try to bridge the gap between the way the two sides see the facts.

Prologue
Ira talks about what’s alarming him about this year’s election: facts seem less meaningful than they ever have, and the gap between the mainstream media and right-wing media’s versions of the world have never seemed further apart. CNN’s Jake Tapper explains what it was like to be on the air live when Donald Trump tried to take a huge, obvious lie and pass it off as the truth. (8 minutes)

Act One
Ira's quest continues. He calls his Uncle Lenny, who gets his news from Fox and the Wall Street Journal, and lives with an entirely different set of facts, and Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration expert at the CATO Institute, who explains that the central issue in Donald Trump’s candidacy is based on something that isn’t true. (11 minutes)

Act Two
In this election year we look at the story of one small ballot initiative, in one state. We heard this referendum would gut Georgia's Judicial Qualifications Commission (JQC), an independent organization that investigates ethics complaints about judges. Years ago, the JQC investigated a judge we did a whole episode about, Amanda Williams, and she resigned from the bench. We wondered why in the world someone would want to tamper with an agency that seemed to be doing a good job at a low cost. Producer David Kestenbaum went to Georgia to figure out what was going on. (21 minutes)

Act Three
Ira explains that when Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton all seemed to be against free trade agreements, he got genuinely confused. Is free trade good or bad?  Was NAFTA good or evil? Are we down with TPP? He asked Jacob Goldstein of NPR’s Planet Money podcast to explain, once and for all, the pros and cons of free trade. (7 minutes)

Act Four
We’ve been wondering about some of the things President Obama thinks about the current election, but can’t say publicly. But since he hasn’t told us his thoughts explicitly, we asked singer/songwriter Sara Bareilles – who did the Broadway musical “Waitress” – to imagine those thoughts for us. One of the stars of Hamilton, Leslie Odom Jr., performs the song. Music direction by Nadia DiGiallonardo, strings orchestration by Alex Lacamoire. Recorded and mixed by Derik Lee Emily Grishman, music copyist Lee Nadel, bass Jonathan Dinklage, violin Adele Stein, cello Todd Low, viola Antoine Silverman, violin2 (4 minutes)

      <description>Right now lots of Republicans feel like they don’t recognize their own party. Like a Minnesota congressman who’s confused when the residents in his district, people he’s known for years, start calling for a ban on Muslims moving to their town.

Prologue
There’s a seismic, historic change going on in the Republican party this year. Producer Zoe Chace tells Ira about a place you can eavesdrop on a group of Republican friends as they fret and argue about that change week after week: a podcast called Ricochet. Ira talks to Rob Long, one of the hosts of the podcast, and to Avik Roy, who’s appeared on the show. Zoe believes many people in the Republican leadership seem like tragic figures this year. Like Paul Ryan, Speaker of the House. Songwriters Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez imagine what he’s feeling but can’t say publicly. Neil Patrick Harris sings the part of Paul Ryan. Orchestration and music direction: Stephen Oremus. Emily Bruskin Yarbrough, violin Erin Benim Maryland, violin Jonathan Dinklage, viola Allison Seidner, cello Brian Miller, flute and piccolo Tony Kadleck, trumpet Theodore Primis, horn Recorded and mixed by John Kilgore Program note: In an excerpt of the podcast Ricochet in the prologue to our show, someone misattributes a quote to the film Jaws that actually was from the movie Miller’s Crossing. Both are great films. The correct quote: "I'd worry a lot less if I thought you were worrying enough." All parties regret the error. (12 minutes) _Zoe Chace, Ira Glass_

Act One
One way to understand the split inside the Republican party is to look at immigration. It’s this urgent, emotional issue for so much of the party these days. But why? Over the past year, as producer Zoe Chace has covered the election, she has wondered, why immigration NOW? She had a hard time getting any answers — and then she stumbled upon a small city in Minnesota called St. Cloud. Zoe connects the anti-immigrant sentiment in St. Cloud with a national network of organizations promoting anti-Muslim views and spreading fear about Sharia law. We hear how the Somali immigrants in town deal with their neighbors’ fears. And then a violent attack at a local mall inflames both sides. (44 minutes) _Zoe Chace_

Act Two
(Podcast and Internet Only) Another tragic figure this year is the head of the Republican National Comittee Reince Priebus, who has the job of holding the whole party together. A grueling and thankless job, this year. We asked Broadway composer Michael Friedman – who did a political musical called Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson – to imagine what Priebus might be thinking but not expressing publicly. John Ellison Conlee sings the part of Reince Priebus. Justin Goldner, electric bass, tenor banjo Freddy Hall, guitar, ukelele Kevin Garcia, drum set Recorded and mixed by Jeff Cook Arrangements and music direction by Justin Levine.

      <description>A story about Hillary Clinton that offers a different picture than what we’ve been hearing from both sides during this campaign. And some funny stuff, because everyone’s tired of the election.

Prologue
There’s a political parable about Hillary Clinton that’s made the rounds this year. Host Ira Glass interviews contributor Jack Hitt, who says that in this parable you can see almost every version of Hillary that exists in the popular imagination: the A student, the opportunist, the mastermind, the rat fink, the pragmatist, the truth-twister. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass, Jack Hitt_

Act One
Sean Cole talks to reporter Garrett Graff , who read the 247 pages of interview summaries of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails. Graff concludes that it’s not the scandal most people thought it was. Not a sophisticated, Machiavellian scheme to evade federal rules and record laws. The interviews “depict less a sinister and carefully calculated effort to avoid transparency than a busy and uninterested executive who shows little comfort with even the basics of technology, working with a small, harried inner circle of aides. Reading the FBI’s interviews, Clinton’s team hardly seems organized enough to mount any sort of sinister cover-up.” (19 minutes) _Sean Cole_

Act Two
After Huma Abedin’s emails were discovered on her husband’s computer by the FBI, and after FBI Director James Comey publicly declared the agency would be investigating those emails, Hillary Clinton’s poll numbers dropped. What was the conversation Huma Abedin then had with her boss, Hillary Clinton? Actors Tami Sagher and Cady Huffman tried to imagine it. (3 minutes)

Act Three
Comedian Mike Birbiglia, his wife and his cat take a trip together and meet some parasitic zombie mice. (8 minutes) _Mike Birbiglia_

Act Four
The first day on the job inevitably means mistakes, mishaps, and, sometimes, fiascos. A true story, about a rookie cop, told by the cop. (12 minutes)

(10 minutes) _Howie Chackowicz_

Act Four
Alex Blumberg investigates a little-studied phenomenon: Children who get a mistaken idea in their heads about how something works or what something means, and then don't figure out until well into adulthood that they were wrong.

It was hard to find, hard to prove—until they stumbled across what could have been the best present ever: a seemingly clear-cut case of Democrats out to rig the election. Producer Zoe Chace went to Bladen County, N.C. to investigate. (18 minutes) _Zoe Chace_

      <description>We’ve fought two wars since 9/11. We got help from tens of thousands of Iraqis and Afghans—some were targeted or killed because they helped us. We owe these people. We’ve passed laws that say so. So why has it been so hard for us to get many of them to safety?

Prologue
Host Ira Glass interviews Congressman Seth Moulton (D., Mass.), who served four tours as a Marine in Iraq. Moulton talks about an Iraqi translator he grew close to, and about a special visa program that allows Iraqi and Afghan translators to come to the U.S. What will happen to the program after Trump takes office? (8 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
An Iraqi translator named Sarah has been trying to get to the U.S. for eight years. Finally, this fall, she got a call to come in for an interview for her visa. Now she was one step away from a verdict that could lead to a new life for her and her two sons—or leave them in jeopardy. Producer Nancy Updike tells what happened. (23 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Two
Nancy returns with a story that explains the origins of the special visa program for interpreters. A decade ago, a young guy named Kirk Johnson inadvertently became the point person for American policy about the Iraqis and Afghans endangered by their work for us. Kirk reflects on the visa program’s successes and failures—and on how, recently, his advice to translators who want to immigrate to the U.S. has radically changed. (25 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

      <description>This week we document what happened when the President’s executive order went into effect temporarily banning travel from seven countries, and we talk about the way it was implemented. A major policy change thrown into the world like a fastball with no warning. It’s hard not to ask: “What just happened? What was that all about?”

Prologue
This week we document what happened when the President’s executive order went into effect, and talk about the way it was implemented. A major policy change thrown into the world like a fastball with no warning. It’s hard not to ask: “What just happened? What was that all about?” (13 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
The news of the executive order broke while immigrants and refugees were mid-flight. That meant they were stranded in airports around the country. Zoe Chace has one of their stories, from JFK. (10 minutes) _Zoe Chace_

Act Two
One of the justifications for the executive order from the administration was that we needed to temporarily stop admitting immigrants and refugees from these seven countries in order to scrutinize and improve the vetting process. Ira speaks with the vetters about how they vet and what they make of the new order. (11 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three

      <description>What it's actually like to live in the confusing information landscape that is Putin's Russia.

Prologue
Ira talks to Russian reporter Anna Nemtsova in Moscow about the recent subway bombing in St. Petersburg and the conspiracy theories she heard from Russians as soon as news about the bombing started to spread. Anna Nemtsova is a correspondent for The Daily Beast and Newsweek. Ira quotes this recent article in The Guardian about Putin by Keith Gessen. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Back in 1999 there was a series of bombings of apartment buildings in Moscow and across Russia. 300 people died. It happened just as Vladimir Putin was coming to power. And there was a question whether Putin or other people in the Kremlin might have been involved. Producer Robyn Semien talked to reporters who covered the bombings and reviewed the evidence. Robyn talks to reporter Scott Anderson in this story. His article "None Dare Call It a Conspiracy" originally appeared in the pages of GQ. (20 minutes) _Robyn Semien_

Act Two
Vladmir Putin’s approval rating is a seemingly unreal 84%. Ira talks to reporter Charles Maynes to find out if that number is real and how it could be that high. Then Charles talks to a Putin supporter who explains why she loves her president. (10 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
Disinformation and propaganda works differently in Putin’s Russia than it did during the Soviet Union. Instead of tamping down the opposition, the Russian government works to control the opposition. Producer Sean Cole introduces us to Putin’s right-hand man who is credited with inventing this new way of controlling information. One of the journalists Sean speaks to in this story is Peter Pomerantsev. He’s the author of the book "Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia." Peter Pomerantsev wrote about Vladislav Surkov for The Atlantic . (15 minutes) _Sean Cole_

Act Four
The anti-government protests last month in Russia were surprising for a few reasons – including the fact that they included tons of young people. After the protests, teenagers started posting videos to the internet of their teachers lecturing them about the protests and the kids arguing back. Ira talks to reporter Joshua Yaffa about a video that one student filmed in the town of Bryansk. Joshua Yaffa wrote about the protest and the video for The New Yorker . (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>Before Donald Trump started his presidential campaign in 2015, there was a congressional race that redefined what was possible in American politics. Steve Bannon and Breitbart News got involved in that race early, just like they later got deeply involved in Donald Trump's race. On this week’s show: What happened in that campaign, what it made it work, and how we got to now.

Prologue
Vice News producer Reid Cherlin tells Ira about a party he attended in Washington in 2014. At the time he thought everyone there was on the fringe of the right wing, largely irrelevant. Now many of the people who were at that party are the most influential figures in Donald Trump’s administration. (8 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
In 2014, in the wake of losing the previous presidential election, the Republican Party had committed itself to immigration reform as its only path to winning elections in the future. Within two years, Donald Trump would be elected on the exact opposite platform, railing against immigration. Producer Zoe Chace tells the story of the Congressional race that inspired that dramatic 180. (33 minutes) _Zoe Chace_

Act Two
For years Pat Buchanan ran on many of the same ideas that Donald Trump would later run on. Buchanan lost — three times. Trump won. Why? Is Buchanan jealous? And does he think Trump’s election is the beginning of a new normal, or a small blip in the course of history? Ira and Zoe visit his home to ask him. (14 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>To be, or not to be a pirate? This week, that is the question. Hold fast, mateys! We have stories about both historical and modern-day swashbucklers who loot, pillage, and question their choices.

Prologue
Ira talks to producer Elna Baker about Stede Bonnet, a nobleman who woke up one day and decided that his new life goal was to become a pirate. You can read the trials of Stede Bonnet online. (12 1/2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Mohammed Aden was just a regular Minnesotan dad who unwittingly became governor of a region in Somalia. As governor, one of his main goals was to eliminate piracy. So why is he now sitting in prison for colluding with pirates? Producer Dana Chivvis investigates. (42 minutes) _Dana Chivvis_

Act Two
Producer Stephanie Foo talks to author and pirate historian Laura Sook Duncombe about the most successful pirate of all time, Cheng I Sao. Duncombe is author of the book "Pirate Women: The Princesses, Prostitutes and Privateers Who Ruled the Seven Seas." (8 minutes) _Stephanie Foo_

      <description>Three people grapple with the question, “Are we alone?”

Prologue
If there is intelligent life elsewhere in the universe, why haven’t we heard from the extraterrestrials yet? Producer David Kestenbaum explains The Fermi Paradox to host Ira Glass. The possibility that we are alone in the universe makes David sad. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass, David Kestenbaum_

Act One
David’s story continues. He visits his old physics professor, who helps him figure out what to think. And Ira checks in with Dan Werthimer, chief scientist for SETI–the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence–at Berkeley. Your personal computer can help SETI crunch through its data looking for intelligent life with seti@home . (15 minutes) _Ira Glass, David Kestenbaum_

Act Two
We turn now to one of the loneliest experiences a person can have: marriage. Ira listens to two people trying to break through what’s going wrong in their marriage, an excerpt from a new podcast in which real couples have a real therapy session with a real therapist, Esther Perel . Her podcast is Where Should We Begin? with Esther Perel . (20 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
One night Rosie’s father, busy working, told Rosie, then 9, to stop distracting him with her questions. She should write them all down, he said. Rosie returned with about 50 of the most fundamental human questions. Three years later, her father is still answering them. Producer Stephanie Foo tells the story. Matt Salyer is working on a collection of poems that’s coming out later this year called "Ravage and Snare." (12 minutes) _Stephanie Foo_

      <description>Just a few years before he got the internship at NPR that started him in radio, our host Ira Glass had another career. He performed magic at children's birthday parties. A powerful sense of embarrassment has prevented him from ever doing an episode on the subject, but when he learned that producer David Kestenbaum was also a kid conjurer, they decided to dive in together.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks to producer David Kestenbaum about what it was like to be a kid magician. (9 minutes) _Ira Glass, David Kestenbaum_

Act One
Magicians say it can take years to create and polish a new magic trick. Teller (of Penn and Teller) shows host Ira Glass how he invented one of his most beautiful and puzzling routines. See Teller do The Red Ball trick and read a few pages from David P. Abbott’s book, where he describes how to do the floating ball routine. (22 minutes) _Ira Glass, David Kestenbaum_

Act Two
Producer David Kestenbaum became obsessed with one trick he loved as a kid—when David Copperfield made the statue of liberty disappear. (24 minutes) _David Kestenbaum_

      <description>Most of the time, we show the world a pretty superficial version of ourselves. "How about that weather?" But this week—people who try to go deeper, to get to something real, in some unexpected places: war, magic and porn.

Prologue
Producer Chana Joffe-Walt tells Ira about a man who decided to do a drag act at his child's elementary school talent show. (7 1/2 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt_

Act One
Earlier this month, North Korea fired an intercontinental ballistic missile… one powerful enough, news reports said, to reach Alaska. People were shocked. But maybe that was because we were not being real with ourselves about what was going on in North Korea. How did we get to this point? Producer David Kestenbaum has been listening to a podcast called Arms Control Wonk that explains it. (17 1/2 minutes) _David Kestenbaum_

Act Two
Ira with two magicians who take the premise of magic – that it’s all about deception – and try to stand that on its head to get to something utterly real, unfaked and emotional. David Blaine is on tour for the summer. Derek Delgaudio’s show In and Of Itself is running in New York through December. Here's the video we play in this act of David Blaine performing for Ricky Gervais. (16 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
Jon Ronson has been working on a podcast for over a year that traces how one man changed the porn business, when he applied modern internet technology — keywords, search-term optimization — to porn. One big obvious consequence of this is that so much pornography is given away for free, people who make porn videos have a much harder time making a living. One way lots of them now supplement their income is by creating custom videos. Jon Ronson’s new Audible Original Series The Butterfly Effect will premiere at the end of July. You can pre-order it now. (10 minutes) _Jon Ronson_

      <description>Two towns where people got really upset about undocumented immigrants, even though in both places, that did not seem to be the most important thing happening at all. One of the towns, a small town in Alaska, has no undocumented immigrants at all, but the possibility of them arriving put the whole town at each other’s throats.

Prologue
Ira talks to our Senior Producer Brian Reed about a fight that’s been brewing in the remote town of Homer, Alaska over a resolution that states that Homer welcomes immigrants. Which is odd. Because the town has virtually no immigrants. (9 1/2 minutes)

Act One
Brian Reed continues his story about the town of Homer, Alaska. He talked to all sorts of people involved in the debate over whether the town should welcome immigrants. He was particularly interested in one guy. A guy named Ben, who didn’t know what he thought about the resolution. (28 minutes) _Brian Reed_

Act Two
In the first half of the show, we documented a community that was worried about what might happen, theoretically, if undocumented immigrants arrived. In this act, Producer Zoe Chace looks at a community where the immigrants have already arrived – Rockville, Maryland. It’s a suburb of Washington D.C. where early in 2017, something actually did happen. And the whole community had to deal with it. (18 minutes) _Zoe Chace_

      <description>When everything goes wrong, one of the first things we think is, "Who do I call?" This week, stories of lucky people who have found the exact right person to ring up for help.

Prologue
Guest host Sean Cole tells a story about how he found the very perfect person to call for things large and small, and how Sean might be his guru's perfect person, too. (10 minutes) _Sean Cole_

Act One
Bob Fass has been a radio host on WBAI since 1963, often taking calls from strangers late at night. One night at 3 a.m. in 1971, a man called into his show facing a literally life-or-death dilemma. Sean Cole has the story. We received the audio from this story from the documentary Radio Unnameable. It's streaming on Amazon and iTunes , or you can buy the DVD with lots of extras . The archival recordings used in this segment, as well as other recordings and materials of Bob Fass and Radio Unnameable, are available at the Bob Fass Archive at the Rare Book & Manuscript Library at Columbia University. (23 minutes) _Sean Cole_

Act Two
Reporter Aaron Reiss found a woman that an entire community calls, in order to find out the names of the very streets they're walking on. She's the gatekeeper for a series of secret underground maps of New York City. This piece was co-reported by Jenny Ye . (6 minutes) _Aaron Reiss, Jenny Ye_

Act Three
Ira Glass' friend Lucy used to love listening to the radio psychologist Joy Browne , who she thought always had the best advice. But is it possible for someone's advice to just be too good? Ira Glass talks to Lucy to find out. (16 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>One of our producers, Neil Drumming, has recently become fascinated with Afrofuturism. It's more than sci-fi. It’s a way of looking at black culture that’s fantastic, creative, and oddly hopeful—which feels especially urgent during a time without a lot of optimism.

Prologue
Ira and producer Neil Drumming visit a comic book store in Philadelphia to try and help Ira understand Afrofuturism. (9 minutes) _Neil Drumming_

Act One
Producer Neil Drumming spends a couple days exploring Detroit, first with a quirky mayoral candidate running an Afrofuturist campaign, and then with a couple of locals. (12 minutes) _Neil Drumming_

Act Two
Comedian and actor Azie Dungey recounts her time playing a slave for visiting tourists at George Washington’s estate in Mount Vernon. (12 minutes) _Azie Dungey_

Act Three
This American Life commissioned an original song, “The Deep,” from the hip-hop group clppng. , featuring actor and Hamilton performer Daveed Diggs. The song is based on the underwater mythology of the 90s Detroit electro band Drexciya. (6 minutes)

Act Four
Producer Neil Drumming looks into two videos he found on YouTube—one that takes place in Atlantic City , another in Brooklyn —that deal with the trouble kids face walking home from school. (13 minutes) _Neil Drumming_

      <description>Everyone walks around on their own private map of the world. The places we’re from and how they made us, whether we like it or not.

Prologue
Ira talks to Australian novelist Gerald Murnane. He’s never left Australia. He’s never been on a plane. And then he was nominated for the Melbourne Prize for Literature, a prize which asks the recipients to spend half the cash prize on international travel. Ira talks to Helen Garner who wrote about what happened, in an essay in her book Everywhere I Look . Murnane’s best known novel is probably The Plains . He has two books coming out soon: Border Districts and Stream System . (6 minutes)

Act One
Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos is from Grand Rapids, Michigan. So is This American Life producer Susan Burton. During Devos’s nomination hearings, critics accused her of never having set foot in a public school. But it turns out that years ago she did—as a volunteer mentor. Susan returned to Grand Rapids to find out what DeVos's experience in a public school in her hometown can tell us about her vision for education in this country. (29 minutes) _Susan Burton_

Act Two
Will McMillan found a home in the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses when he was a teenager. Ultimately he was kicked out of the church. Disfellowshipped. But he can’t help himself. He still believes. Producer Neil Drumming, who was raised a Jehovah’s Witness, talks to Will. (20 minutes) _Neil Drumming_

      <description>In 1967, the first two Black students were enrolled at an all-white private boarding school in Virginia. The main reason they were there? To benefit the white kids.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks to Mariya Karimjee about a college application essay question. Essay B asks students to imagine a person they might meet in college—someone from a very different background. Ten years ago, Mariya’s mostly white high school classmates in Texas didn’t write about an imaginary person they might meet in the future. They just wrote about the one different person they already knew—Mariya. (15 minutes) _Mariya Karimjee_

Act One
Back in the late 1960s, a wealthy tobacco heiress saw that integration was happening all around the country—except at prep schools in the South. So she set out to find the best Black students in neighborhood public schools—in hopes of teaching the white prep-school students to be less bigoted. Mosi Secret tells the story of how the first two Black students to integrate Virginia Episcopal School succeeded beyond anyone’s expectations. A version of this story appears in The New York Times Magazine . (26 minutes) _Mosi Secret_

Act Two
Mosi Secret’s story continues. We find out about a Black student who struggled at VES. And learn what, almost fifty years later, a white student makes of an experiment supposedly undertaken for his benefit. (13 minutes)

      <description>Right-wing groups like the Proud Boys say they have no tolerance for racism or white supremacist groups. Their leader Gavin McInnes disavowed the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville. But the Proud Boys believe “the West is the best,” which, one of them points out, is not such a big jump from “whites are best.” And one of the Proud Boys organized the Charlottesville rally. (The group now claims he was a spy.) What should we make of groups like this?

Prologue
Last month, after white nationalists and members of the alt-right and offshoot groups descended on Charlottesville, Virginia, and marched with torches, the staff of our show realized something: The guy who organized the rally was a member of a right wing men's group that our producer Zoe Chace had been following for months, long before the rally was planned. And she’d learned that the group had an unlikely spiritual advisor: a liberal, black relationship consultant and comedian named Dante Nero. Ira introduces us to him. (3 minutes)

Act One
Dante Nero has been involved in this group for years, since before it even had a name. He’s seen its 
evolution. And he is now deeply disturbed to learn that some members attended the Charlottesville 
rally, including the guy who organized it. Zoe tells Dante's story. (29 minutes) _Zoe Chace_

Act Two
The man who organized the rally in Charlottesville is named Jason Kessler. He says he’s not to blame for the violence that happened there, including the death of a counter protester. In fact, he put the blame on somebody else: a black politician in Charlottesville. Producer Robyn Semien talks to them both about it. (24 minutes) _Robyn Semien_

      <description>Who thought that would be good for a kid?

Prologue
Ira remembers the time when his older sister, Randi, asked his mother where babies come 
from. (3 minutes)

Act One
Producer Neil Drumming talks with the rapper Breeze Brewin about a toy car they both loved playing with as kids: The General Lee from the hit TV show The Dukes of Hazzard. Breeze went on to record a song called “ Generally ” about The General Lee with his group the Juggaknots . (11 minutes) _Neil Drumming_

Act Two
There’s a museum in Baltimore that was created to memorialize the Black experience in America. It’s called The National Great Blacks in Wax Museum . Our producer B.A. Parker went there as a kid, and its straightforward and sometimes disturbing look at history stuck with her. So she went back. (14 minutes) _B.A. Parker_

Act Three
Over the last few years, there’s been a flood of kids from Central America who’ve arrived in the United States by themselves. With no adults. And often, they have to navigate the immigration system on their own. One of the people who’s helped them is the writer Valeria Luiselli. She worked as a translator in immigration court, where her job was to ask children a series of forty questions. Her story is excerpted from her book Tell Me How It Ends . (17 minutes)

Act Four
Paul Zimmer is eighty-three years old now, and he’s still haunted by something he saw in his teens. Something very few Americans have ever seen: The explosion of an atomic bomb. Paul’s essay originally appeared in The Georgia Review . It is read by actor John Conlee . (6 minutes)

      <description>Stories that take place on the edge of civilization, just out of sight.

Prologue
Every city's got a place like this: that weird no man's land on the outskirts of town, with junk yards and landfills. Charlie Gregerson grew up near that stuff, on Chicago's far south side, and he remembers finding debris from famous Louis Sullivan masterpieces in the garbage dump after those buildings were demolished. (4 minutes)

Act One
Out for a simple pleasure cruise with two friends, Alex Zharov was planning to see Jamaica Bay in New York City. But this end-of-the-day excursion, which should have only lasted 40 minutes, turns into an out-of-control adventure that left him lost, stranded, and bleeding—all within sight of the Empire State Building. Brett Martin reports. (23 minutes) _Brett Martin_

Act Two
There is a four mile long bridge in Naan-jing China, famous for how many people jump off to die by suicide. In 2003, a man named Chen Sah began spending all of his weekends on the bridge, trying to single handedly stop the jumpers. Reporter Mike Paterniti tells his story of meeting Mr. Chen. A story Paterniti wrote about Mr. Chen appears in GQ Magazine . Suicide prevention doesn't usually look like pulling people off a bridge. Learn more about everyday ways of helping someone at risk at the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention . (15 minutes) _Mike Paterniti_

Act Three
The story of the government cracking down on smokestack emissions at a city factory—even though the residents like the emissions. We hear from Jorge Just , who explains the one, magical secret about Chicago that no one outside Chicago ever believes is true. Then we hear from Brian Urbaszewski, Director of Environmental Health Programs for the American Lung Association in Chicago and Julie Armitage, Manager of Compliance and Enforcement for the Bureau of Air at the Illinois State EPA. (9 minutes) _Jorge Just_

      <description>We all love to travel to different places, but not many of us like the stressful, banal process of the journey.

      <description>We spent eight months and did over a hundred interviews to try to bypass the usual rhetoric and get to the bottom of what really happened when undocumented workers showed up in one Alabama town.

Prologue
Today's show came out of something we heard politicians saying. And we wondered — is that true? And the answer set us on this eight-month journey on which we started to learn all kinds of things that we had never imagined.

Act One
We’ve visited Albertville, Alabama many times now, to figure out exactly what happened when the population shifted from 98% white in 1990, to a fourth Latino twenty years later. We interviewed more than one hundred people. Sessions is not totally right, but he’s not totally wrong either. Our main witnesses to what happened in the plants are three long-time workers named Pat and Martha and Carlos. (29 minutes) _Ira Glass, Miki Meek_

Act Two
We hear the companies’ side—they have a totally different story to tell than the workers. We also go to one of the leading researchers on the economic effects of immigrants, Giovanni Peri, who chairs the economics department at UC Davis. He and researcher Justin Wiltshire did a study for us on what happened to wages and jobs in Albertville. They compared wages and employment in the area around Albertville to places in Alabama with similar job markets that did not have an influx of immigrants. Read their full study. (26 minutes) _Ira Glass, Miki Meek_

      <description>So many people in Albertville, Alabama, wondered what it cost them in taxes when thousands of undocumented immigrants moved to their town. One woman drove our host Ira Glass to the grocery store to watch a random Latina mom buy some milk with government assistance to try to prove her point. So what’d all the newcomers really cost? And what was their effect on crime, schools, and politics?

Act One
In the early years, when immigrants first arrived in Albertville, the things that bothered the locals weren’t the things you usually hear about when people talk about immigration. Not jobs or wages or crime. It was small stuff. Neighbor-to-neighbor stuff. (19 minutes) _Ira Glass, Miki Meek_

Act Two
Latino residents decided to organize a peaceful march in support of a path to legal status, and their white neighbors were shocked when 5,000 people poured into the streets. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass, Miki Meek_

Act Three
Suddenly realizing just how many Latinos had moved to town, longtime residents jumped into action, fueled by a wave of national and statewide anti-immigration fever. Then in 2011, Alabama adopted the most extreme anti-immigrant law in the country. (19 minutes) _Ira Glass, Miki Meek_

Act Four
One of the things we were excited to investigate when we went to Alabama was to answer the question at the heart of the immigration debate: what does it cost taxpayers when we let in millions of immigrants, documented and undocumented? In Albertville, how much was it? We asked economist Kim Rueben and her colleague Erin Huffer to run the numbers. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass, Miki Meek_

Act Five
In 2012, the fever broke, and the Albertville city council stopped targeting Latino residents. The mayor says he and the council are taking a cue from the public schools. During the years the city council was picking fights with the city’s Latino population, right across the street, at the offices of the Albertville City Schools, they were taking the exact opposite approach: trying to integrate them into the community. And they did an exceptionally competent job of it. (10 minutes) _Ira Glass, Miki Meek_

      <description>A year into Trump’s presidency, stories of politicians—of both parties—unable to accomplish tasks that seem pretty straightforward.

Prologue
Ira wonders aloud, when it comes to DACA, with broad support from most Americans, including the majority of Trump voters, leaders of both parties and the president himself: Why is a permanent solution so hard? Why are politics so hard? (2 minutes)

Act One

(22 minutes) _Jonathan Menjivar, Julia Preston_

Act Two
Ben Calhoun spent months following some key leaders in the Democratic Party, to find out the party’s best strategy for the future. He got some answers. So many, in fact, that it is hard to say if a single strategy is even a goal, let alone a possibility. (30 minutes) _Ben Calhoun_

      <description>As Harvey Weinstein goes to trial, we have a different kind of #MeToo story about several women who worked for the same man. They tell us not only about their troubling encounters with him, but also about their lives beforehand. Who were they when they entered the workplace, and how did their personal histories shape the way they dealt with his harassment?

Prologue
Producer Chana Joffe-Walt fills in for Ira Glass this week. We hear from a person you don’t normally hear from in these kinds of stories — the partner of a man who has been accused of sexual harassment. She finds herself thinking about an old memory, and reconsidering things she’d come to think of as normal. (7 1/2 minutes.) _Chana Joffe-Walt_

Act One
Growing up, Deanna is told that relationships with men won’t be easy: that men are dumb and she’ll have to make sense of things for them. Throughout her twenties, this proves true. So she’s surprised when she meets a man who’s different — Don. (12 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt_

Act Two
Alternet editors try to figure out what to make of Deanna’s odd behavior at an all-staff dinner. (3 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt_

Act Three
When Onnesha asks Don for a raise, he asks her a weird question. One that brings to mind a realization Onnesha had as a thirteen-year-old at the swimming pool. (6 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt_

Act Four
Don’s behavior grows increasingly troubling to Deanna. (8 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt_

Act Five
Tana is clear on how to deal with Don. She’s the cool girl, he’s the flirty boss.  And then Don does something that seems out of bounds. (14 1/2 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt_

Act Six
Kristen has no trouble naming what’s going on with Don: sexual harassment. She’s the first Alternet employee angry enough to try to do something about it. (16 1/2 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt_

Act Seven
We return to Vivian, Don’s partner, who reflects on how to incorporate some new information into the story of her own relationship with him. (9 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt_

Prologue
Host Ira Glass takes a tour to walls all around the world. (9 minutes)

Act One
There are two tiny Spanish towns on the African continent protected by multiple layers of razor wire, cameras and guards. A man from Cameroon tells producer David Kestenbaum about his attempt to get through the obstacle course and onto European soil. (19 minutes) _David Kestenbaum_

Act Two

Act Four
Where do parents go when they’re deported? For some, the answer is: as close as possible to their kids. That often means Nogales, Mexico. It’s right on the border. But sometimes kids don’t visit as much as you would expect. Reporter Lizzie Presser talked to one family. To help report this story, Lizzie got a grant from the International Women’s Media Foundation . (17 minutes) _Lizzie Presser_

      <description>Before he leaves the Senate for good, Republican Jeff Flake is trying to get a bill passed. He has his work cut out for him, with a Senate that barely brings anything to the floor, a party he feels estranged from, and a president who seems to hate his guts. Producer Zoe Chace hung out with him for four months.

Prologue
Producer Zoe Chace talks with host Ira Glass about following Senator Jeff Flake, and how when he announced his retirement she thought her reporting had ended. But when a Democrat was elected to the senate in Alabama, Flake suddenly found new relevance — in Republican Party politics, and also in the senate where his lame-duck vote now held incredible sway.

Act One
Senator Jeff Flake tries use his newfound leverage to get a commitment to bring DACA to the Senate floor in exchange for his vote for the Republican tax bill. Things change at the last minute. (15 minutes) _Zoe Chace_

Act Two
Senator Jeff Flake goes to the White House and discovers a president who seems to be very open to doing whatever immigration deal the senate brings him. He spends an optimistic 24 hours writing a bill with his bipartisan partners. (17 minutes) _Zoe Chace_

Act Three
Senator Jeff Flake breaks from the plan and speaks openly about the bipartisan DACA proposal to the media before the president has a chance to sell the deal himself. Turns out, that’s not what actually kills the deal. (6 minutes) _Zoe Chace_

Act Four
The government shuts down, and Flake tries to get the senate to ignore what the White House wants. Unsuccessfully. Yet he presses on. (10 minutes) _Zoe Chace_

      <description>Democrats are desperate to retake part of Congress. Their best shot is the House. This fall, they’ll be slugging it out with Republicans—but in the meantime, they’re slugging it out with each other. The progressive and moderate wings of the Democratic party are going head-to-head in Democratic primaries all over the country right now, wrestling over what the party should be and stand for. This week, we have the story of a candidate in one primary like that.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with Ben Calhoun about how Democrats are furiously trying to retake New York’s 19th congressional district. The sitting Republican is considered very vulnerable, and has been the subject of weekly protests that even have a house band. Nationally, Democrats are watching what’s happening in the district. They consider it one of the crucial seats they need to win back to retake the House. But the Democratic primary in NY-19 has been characterized by messy infighting playing out the stubborn split between the progressive and establishment wings of the party. (6 minutes) _Ben Calhoun_

Act One
When Jeff Beals learned who was going to run in the Democratic primary for NY-19, he was disappointed. Beals, a progressive, thought the Democrats jumping in were conventional candidates, ones who embodied what he thinks is a failed strategy for his party: raising lots of money from big donors and lobbyists, and buying TV ads. So Beals decided to run as well—to take his progressive ideas and strategy and face off with the mainstream candidates he didn’t like. Beals learns many things in Democratic politics are slanted against candidates like him. Producer Ben Calhoun spent months with him. (28 minutes) _Ben Calhoun_

Act Two
Beals is running against six other candidates, many of whom say they, too, are progressive. Beals disagrees. He’s pitted himself against them. Beals’s opponents argue that his combative style is harming the party. Meantime, Beals finds himself increasingly at odds with a national arm of the Democratic party that keeps warning him he isn’t raising enough money. Progressive groups step in on Beals’s side as he forges ahead. (22 minutes) _Ben Calhoun_

      <description>An innocent man forgives the cop who framed him. An Argentinian talk show that usually treats women as objects suddenly gets really interested in feminism. This week, stories about changes that seem too tidy to be true.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass talks with Washington Post reporter Kevin Sieff , who has been following a lawyer trying to reunite a father with his 12-year-old daughter. The two were separated at the border as part of President Trump’s zero-tolerance immigration policy. The government won’t tell the lawyer where the daughter is being held. (13 minutes) _Kevin Sieff_

Act One
Reporter Jasmine Garsd grew up in Argentina watching talk shows, which were kind of extreme even for Latin American television. The women on screen were pumped with silicone and Botox, and sometimes showed up wearing almost nothing. Recently one long-time host seemed to have a change of heart overnight. Jasmine went back to Argentina to find out what had happened. This story is a collaboration with the NPR podcast Rough Translation . (23 minutes) _Jasmine Garsd_

Act Two
The TV news stories told it as heartwarming tale of reconciliation from small-town America: a black man who was framed by a white cop decides to forgive him. But those stories left out a few things. Producer Lilly Sullivan looked into it. A lot of the research in this story comes from sociologist Louise Seamster's research about Benton Harbor . You can read more of her work here . (18 minutes) _Lilly Sullivan_

      <description>Yes, youʼve heard about the family separations. Youʼve heard about the travel ban. But there are dozens of ways the Trump administration is cracking down on immigration across many agencies, sometimes in ways so small and technical it doesnʼt make headlines. This week, the quiet bureaucratic war that’s even targeting legal immigrants.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass goes to Tijuana, Mexico where people trying to come to the U.S. asking for asylum have devised a new way to keep track of their place in line. Cindy Carcamo first wrote about this story for the Los Angeles Times . (11 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Reporter Julia Preston goes to a mass hearing in McAllen, Texas where 74 immigrants are being charged in a federal courtroom as a result of zero tolerance. Julia is a contributing writer for The Marshall Project , which published a print version of this story . (13 minutes) _Julia Preston_

Act Two
All the little and not-so-little ways the Trump administration is tightening its scrutiny of immigrants. (9 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
A bunch of government emails recently came out as part of a class-action lawsuit. The emails show new appointees trying to roll back one particular part of immigration policy that could result in half a million people having to leave the United States. Producer Nadia Reiman takes us inside the world of these emails. (10 minutes) _Nadia Reiman_

Act Four
The President has cut the number of refugees officially allowed into the U.S. So a bunch of refugee resettlement offices are shutting down. Producer Zoe Chace goes to one of these offices that’s about to close. (10 minutes) _Zoe Chace_

Act Five
Refugee resettlement policy changed dramatically from the first week President Trump took office. In that first travel ban, the president halted the entire refugee resettlement program, until we could, in his words from the campaign, "Figure out what the hell is going on." Producer Zoe Chace has the story of the group tasked to figure out what the hell was going on, and why the number of refugees resettling is the lowest in the history of the program. _Zoe Chace_

This story is included in Shalom's memoir Foreskin's Lament . His most recent book is Mother for Dinner . (19 minutes) _Shalom Auslander_

      <description>Libraries aren't just for books. They're often spaces that transform into what you need them to be: a classroom, a cyber café, a place to find answers, a quiet spot to be alone. It's actually kind of magical. This week, we have stories of people who roam the stacks and find unexpected things that just happen to be exactly what they required.

Prologue
One Monday earlier this month, we sent five producers to record what happened at library reference desks around the country. (5 1/2 minutes)

Act One
There is a library that's on the border of Canada and the United States — literally on the border, with part of the library in each country. Producer Zoe Chace interviews journalist Yeganeh Torbati about how lately, it's become a critical space for a surprising set of visitors. (7 minutes) _Zoe Chace_

Act Two
In Richard Brautigan's novel " The Abortion ," he imagines a library where regular people can come and drop off their own unpublished books. Nothing is turned away. The books live there forever. It’s the kind of place that would never work in real life. But someone decided to try it. Producer Sean Cole has the story. You can explore the manuscripts of the Brautigan Library online. (28 minutes) _Sean Cole_

Act Three
Lydia Sigwarth spent a lot of time in her public library growing up – all day, almost every day, for six months straight. Producer Stephanie Foo returned to that library with her, after years away. (13 1/2 minutes) _Stephanie Foo_

      <description>The Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee may have to fight to protect Mueller's investigation and make his report public. Now that they’re in the majority, they have new tools they can use. Our producer Zoe Chace spent weeks behind the scenes with them as they tried out their new powers for the first time. This and other stories of people scrambling to get their footing on some challenging terrain.

Prologue
Mike Wise tells Ira about a run he went on one winter night with his dog, years ago along the C&O Canal in DC. It was late. No one was around. And when Mike’s dog accidentally fell through the iced-over canal into the freezing water, Mike suddenly had to navigate the canal himself, to try to save his dog. Mike reads part of a story he wrote about this in the Washington Post . (10 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Jerry Nadler and other democrats in the House Judiciary Committee were anticipating their first major public appearance – and show of power – since winning back the house in November. As Nadler and his staff prepared to get some answers from then-acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker about his role and conduct as interim AG, producer Zoe Chace follows them behind the scenes for weeks in the run-up to the hearing, to see if their strategies work, or don’t. (34 minutes) _Zoe Chace_

Act Two
When Jessica Hopper was inappropriately groped by an anesthesiologist, during labor, she tries to out him that same day, to a roomful of hospital staff who don’t believe her. That sets her on a many year mission to get someone to take up her cause. She exhausts herself trying. And then finds out that at least one person had heard her – someone she hadn’t reached out to on her own. Jessica Hopper's newest book is a memoir called " Night Moves , " and she’ll be the host of season two of KCRW's Lost Notes . (10 minutes) _Jessica Hopper_

      <description>Stories from the upside-down world where conspiracy theorists dwell.

Prologue
Ira tells the story of a guy, Lenny Pozner, who strikes up a conversation with a stranger in a bar, only to learn the guy already knows who Lenny is. And the stranger is furious with him. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Producer Miki Meek picks up the story of Lenny Pozner, whose son, Noah, was killed at Sandy Hook. In the years after Noah's death, Lenny and his family were harassed by people who believed the shooting at Sandy Hook never happened – that it was all a conspiracy. Until one day, Lenny decided to fight back. (24 minutes) _Miki Meek_

Act Two
Alex Jones spread the idea that Sandy Hook was a hoax, on his radio show and website for years after the shooting. He's probably the country's most famous conspiracy theorist. He's even had Donald Trump on his show. Reporter Jon Ronson travels to Jones' hometown in Texas, to investigate the story Jones tells about himself, and how he became who he is.  Jon Ronson and his producer Lina Misitzis originally created a version of this story for Audible. They also produced Jon’s latest series, a longform Original “ The Last Days of August ,” the never-before-told story of what caused the untimely death of 23-year-old porn star August Ames. It’s available exclusively on Audible.com . (27 minutes) _Jon Ronson_

      <description>Stories of very small injustices and also one very big one.

Prologue
Producer David Kestenbaum explains how teachers at his sons’ preschool installed a “tattle phone” where kids could register their complaints about each other. David rigged it up to record those complaints and document the unfairnesses of preschool. (12 minutes) _David Kestenbaum_

Act One
Writer Michael Lewis takes us inside the world of NBA refereeing. He explains how protests about unfair calls have increased in recent years. However, at the same time, hard evidence suggests referees have only gotten better and better at making good calls. Lewis says this is actually indicative of a larger trend in America — people distrusting authorities, judges and referees of all kinds. This story is a version of the first episode of his new podcast Against the Rules . (32 minutes) _Michael Lewis_

Act Two
When Heidi Schreck was 15 years old she loved the United States Constitution — in part, because she believed it enshrined the idea of fairness. She traveled to American Legion posts across the country, where she competed in speaking competitions about the Constitution. She was so successful that she was able to pay for her college education with the winnings. But once Schreck was an adult, she came to several realizations about the Constitution’s shortcomings and oversights. These days, she sees it as a flawed document. All of this is the subject of Schreck’s play “ What the Constitution Means to Me .” (12 minutes) _Heidi Schreck_

Prologue
Ira goes to a crowded singles bar where it wasn’t hard to find serial ghosters — people who kiss and disappear. (8 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
We start with someone getting up the nerve to do something that really, it would be nice to see more often — an apology. And not just any apology. Nancy Updike has this story, about the anatomy of this one particular and unusual instance of, “I’m sorry." (26 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Two
We turn to those who are truly spineless, and I mean literally, they are creatures that have no spines. Also featured in this story: the people who study them who, like us all, could sometimes use a little more spine. Producer Lilly Sullivan explains. (21 minutes) _Lilly Sullivan_

      <description>We return toour story about Abdi Nor from 2015, with some big news about his life today. When we first broadcast the story, Abdi was a Somali refugee living in Kenya desperately trying – against long odds – to get to the United States. Then he got the luckiest break of his life: he won a lottery that puts him on a short list for a U.S. visa. But before he could cash in his golden ticket, the police started raiding his neighborhood, targeting refugees.

Prologue
Three weeks ago, Abdi Nor became a U.S. citizen, in a ceremony in Maine. We go to the ceremony, and then head back in time to 2013, when he won a visa under the Diversity Visa Lottery. _Ira Glass_

Act One
It turns out winning the lottery is only the first step in trying to come to America. More than half of the people who win each year never make it. Abdi is living in Nairobi, Kenya, when he wins, and as he's trying to prepare for his interview at the U.S. Embassy, Kenyan police start relentlessly raiding his neighborhood, rounding up Somalis and taking them away. So Abdi goes into hiding in his apartment. Leo Hornak spoke to Abdi almost every night while this was happening, to find out if Abdi would evade the police and make it to America. Abdi has a memoir called " Call Me American ." (17 minutes) _Leo Hornak_

Act Two
Leo Hornak's story about Abdi continues. Abdi encounters one obstacle after another on the streets of Nairobi. And finally, the moment of truth comes: his embassy interview. A version of Leo's story first aired on the BBC show Crossing Continents . (31 minutes) _Leo Hornak_

      <description>Lissa Yellow Bird searches for missing people. Cold cases, mostly. People no one else is looking for. It’s not her job, but a lot of Native Americans go missing and their cases remain unsolved, so families often ask Lissa for help. But then, Lissa’s own niece goes missing.

Since then, many Native American families have asked for Lissa’s help looking for their loved ones, too.

Act Two
Lissa knows how to read people, how to pull information out of them that others can’t. Because of this, she’s able to find out what happened to her niece in just five days. But finding out what happened doesn’t even come close to resolving anything. (23 minutes) _Sierra Crane Murdoch_

      <description>Michigan has passed its Covid-19 peak, and the state has started opening up. But it’s still been intensely difficult for the staff in the ICU at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. We've embedded with them over the past few months, and tracked how this pandemic has changed them and their city.

Prologue
We meet the doctors. Rana Awdish spends hours of each day walking the floors of the ICU checking in on her co-workers, which means that maybe more than any single person in the hospital she knows best what the staff has been going through at each stage of this pandemic. One doctor that has deep ties to Detroit is Geneva Tatem. She’s one of the few Black doctors in the ICU and has a deep awareness of what Covid-19 has done to families in the city. (13 minutes) _Miki Meek, Robyn Semien, Ira Glass_

Act One
When it comes to caring for Covid-19 patients, it’s the nurses who are carrying the heaviest burden. Ben Calhoun spent weeks talking to the nurses in the first Covid-19 unit to open in the ICU – Pod 4. (17 minutes) _Ben Calhoun_

Act Two
We found out about a patient from a recording made by young doctor named Stan Linder. Producer Emanuele Berry put this together. It begins with a voice memo Stan recorded for us on his phone. (10 minutes) _Emanuele Berry_

Act Three
Robert Granger was a patient in Pod 4 for several weeks. During that time, his daughter learns something about him she'd never realized before. (12 minutes) _Emanuele Berry_

Act Four
Some of the first Covid-19 patients to arrive at Henry Ford Hospital were police and others who’d attended a community breakfast in early March called "Police and Pancakes." Aaron K. Foley has this story of this breakfast and of one man — Marlowe Stoudamire — who ended up at Henry Ford. (20 minutes) _Aaron K. Foley_

      <description>Years ago, producer Chana Joffe-Walt started reporting on one school in New York. She thought the story was about segregation and inequality in public schools. But the more she looked into it, the more she realized she was witnessing something else. She was seeing the inordinate power of white parents at this school. This is the first episode of Chana’s new mini-series:Nice White Parents.

Prologue
When the trailer was released for Chana Joffe-Walt’s new show, it prompted a kind of online war. Within a week, people left thousands of ratings and comments: some saying it was divisive and racist; others saying the opposite. But nobody had even heard the show yet. Ira Glass talks about what the discussion illuminates about the show and about this moment. (2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
In just one year, everything in one ordinary public middle school changed. It went from an incoming class of thirty sixth graders—most of them Black, Latino, and Middle Eastern—to a class of 103 sixth graders. The influx was driven by wealthy white students. Producer Chana Joffe-Walt follows how that works out. (29 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt_

Act Two
As the school year moved forward, the fundraising committee planned a gala at the French Embassy. And the PTA planned a separate, Spring Carnival. Chana explains what happens as quiet resentments lock in place between the two groups of parents. (25 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt_

      <description>From the moment we wake up in the morning there are a trillion rules — big and little — governing our lives. But sometimes, we encounter one we just can't abide by. In a pitched moment of rule-questioning, a show about rules and the people who break them.

Prologue
Benjamen Walker of the podcast Theory of Everything tells guest host Sean Cole about an Uber drivers strike he came across in Kenya. The guys who didn’t join the strike and kept driving for Uber made extra money since there were fewer cars on the road. The strikers felt like it was impossible to beat Uber. But some of them knew a way. (10 minutes) _Sean Cole_

Act One
Jerome Ellis is a composer and musician. But this year, at an annual New Year's Day performance event, he got on stage with no instrument, or anything else, and broke a small rule in a monumental way. (24 minutes) _Sean Cole_

Act Two
As a kid, comedian Tone Bell was a rule follower. But there was one time he got into big trouble when he broke the rules in a serious way. There’s a Polaroid commemorating the event that’s become part of family lore. Tone tells producer Elna Baker what happened. (21 minutes) _Elna Baker_

Act Three
This clip is from what Ira calls “the beachiest show” public radio ever made. It’s a segment from NPR’s 1970’s show, Ocean Hour . In it we hear from a man who lives on the beach, literally. He explains how it provides him everything he needs to survive. You can hear the original hour of radio , which included The Beachcomber, courtesy of Nation Public Radio, Inc.

      <description>Sarah Vowell and her twin sister Amy headed out on the road to retrace the Trail of Tears – the route their Cherokee ancestors took when expelled from their own land – and reflected on the question, what are we supposed to do with the mix of good and bad that is this country?

      <description>Stories of people who are tied together, but imagine radically different futures. In one case, a movie star and her ex-husband plot against Kim Jong-Il. In another, a woman stalks her doppelgänger. And sometimes, one bed is the basis for an entire relationship, even for a man who almost never sees the person who shares his bed.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass discusses what it means to peacefully transfer power from one president to the next. He points out one of the weirdest things about it, that the new president has to go and sleep in the same bedroom as the previous president. (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Kim Jong-Il loved movies, but hated all the movies made in North Korea. So he kidnapped a famous South Korean director and his ex-wife—a South Korean film star—locked them up in a villa in North Korea, and forced them to make movies for him. Nancy Updike tells the story. (21 minutes) _Nancy Updike_

Act Two
Lots of people in America share actual beds, but almost never see each other; flight attendants have crash pads near airports, oil rig workers carry their own sheets and sleep in shifts in an RV. Producer Stephanie Foo has a profile of Mexican immigrants who share a few beds in a tiny trailer in upstate New York. (6 minutes) _Stephanie Foo_

Act Three
When someone stole Jessamyn Lovell’s ID, she became obsessed with the thief. Miki Meek tells what happened. (19 minutes) _Miki Meek_

      <description>A doctor who breaks the law might go to jail like anybody else. But who decides if that doctor gets to keep their medical license? On today’s show, the not-often-talked-about realm of licensing boards, and the disturbing decisions they sometimes make.

Prologue
For the past couple-two-three weeks, producer Ben Calhoun has been calling around to small town municipal clerks in his home state of Wisconsin, asking them how mail-in balloting really works.

Producer Dana Chivvis reports on what Rebecca uncovered. (16 minutes) _Dana Chivvis_

Act Two
Dana Chivvis’s story on the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners continues with Dr. Michael LaPaglia’s contested case hearing. Rebecca Allensworth’s article about medical boards and Dr. Michael LaPaglia’s case is at the New York Review of Books . (26 minutes) _Dana Chivvis_

      <description>People who are worried — or not worried enough! — about what's hurtling unstoppably towards them.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass speaks to Kevin Sheekey, the man tasked with spending $100m of Mike Bloomberg’s billions on securing a Democrat win in the constant battleground state of Florida.

Act Two
Michael Bernard Loggins tried to battle his fears by listing them — at last count he had a list of 138 fears. Actor Tom Wright reads excerpts.

Ten years ago Jonathan Menjivar was on the cusp of something big: the birth of his daughter.

      <description>Ahead of the election, we have stories about people trying to live in the unreality that defines this moment. Election officials combat a contagion among their very own workers; people who've never owned guns suddenly go buy them; and two women who allege they were sexually assaulted by the president compare notes.

Prologue
Ira gives us a recent shortlist of things that feel almost too unreal to believe as we head into the national election. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
The journalist E. Jean Carroll is one of dozens of women who’ve accused the president of sexual assault or harassment. These stories have been so widely covered and everyone’s so used to them that to Carroll, it felt like at this point they were just being ignored.  Which seemed sort of incredible to her. She has a frank conversation with another one of the president’s accusers, Jessica Leeds. The story is adapted from a series in The Atlantic . E. Jean Carroll is the author of the memoir What Do We Need Men For? (16 minutes)

Act Two
The statistics on first time gun ownership are higher than ever in America. Producer Lilly Sullivan wants to know: What inspired people to buy a gun right now? What are people afraid of? (16 minutes) _Lilly Sullivan_

Act Three
Reporter Johnny Kauffman embeds with the election staff in Georgia’s most populated county to find out if the staff—who had a horrible go of it during the primary election—can possibly do better this time. (14 minutes) _Johnny Kauffman_

      <description>What the day-to-day business of saving the world looks like. We visit with one group of people who are trying to rescue us from something very large, and another group trying to rescue us from something very small.

Prologue
To fight those massive fires out west, there are these camps hidden from view. If you were driving by, you might not even know they’re there. We visited one of them in central California for the Creek Fire — one of the largest fires in the state’s history. Hundreds of people were living and working there, trying to put the fire out. The first crew we met was this young group of twenty-somethings who spend all day, every day, untangling miles and miles of fire hoses. Producer Miki Meek talks to them. (5 minutes) _Miki Meek_

Act One
We heard about these fire camps from Lizzie Johnson. She’s a reporter at The San Francisco Chronicle and spends most of the year chasing fires around California. She took Miki and one of our other producers, Lilly Sullivan, to the Creek Fire camp with her and has stories of people doing all kinds of jobs you never think about — from laundry to printing maps and hiking out to the farthest corners of a blaze. More from Lizzie: Paradise: One Town's Struggle to Survive an American Wildfire San Francisco Chronicle: The Evidence Burns Away (29 minutes) _Lizzie Johnson_

Act Two
For years one group of people has been trying to push a giant boulder to the top of a hill, like Sisyphus. But in this case, it looks like they’ve actually succeeded! David Kestenbaum spoke with four scientists who have been working on a coronavirus vaccine, one that was just shown to work. (21 minutes) _David Kestenbaum_

      <description>So many of us, we don’t want to think about death. We avoid grieving when we lose someone, distract ourselves, look away. In this episode, at a moment when so many families are mourning, we have stories of people figuring out how they’ll grieve, and doing a pretty good job of it.

Prologue
Ira talks with comedian Rob Delany, who suffered the worst kind of loss a parent can endure — the death of his two-year-old son, Henry. Rob describes what his grief has been like and what he’s learned from it. (11 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Producer Chana Joffe-Walt wondered what it was like for surviving MTA employees coping with the loss of their co-workers due to Covid-19.

Producer Bim Adewunmi travels to the site in Minneapolis where George Floyd was murdered by a police officer. It’s become a huge, make-shift memorial, big enough to absorb the grief of all-comers who wish to pay homage. (10 minutes) _Bim Adewunmi, Aviva DeKornfeld_

Act Four
One of the 590,000 casualties of U.S. Covid-19 this year was Leiah Danielle Jones. She was one of the “long haulers,” and she died in March 2021. But not before writing her own obituary . (7 minutes)

      <description>The bonds between sisters and how they get broken and fixed—or not.

Prologue
In families with sisters, every sister has their role to play. And whatever your role is, it sort of becomes your identity: the sweet one, the diva, the rebel.

Cindy and Dayana Carcamo are close. But recently, they’ve been struggling with this thing that happened when they were very young. For the first part of their childhood, they didn’t know each other at all. (29 minutes) _Cindy Carcamo_

Act Two
The first act of our show was about someone who has spent decades trying to close the gap with her sister because they were apart until she was eight years old. This next story is the reverse. Megan and Sybil Neuringer were together up through age eight. Their separation started when they were nine. (13 minutes) _Lilly Sullivan_

      <description>What happens when one family goes all in on fighting climate change.

Prologue
So yes, climate change is real and most Americans believe that’s what we’re seeing around us right now. But there are people out there who look at the same evidence the rest of us do and take it to heart in a way most of us don’t. They have a wake-up moment. (5 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Producer Aviva DeKornfeld was interested in the toll that having a wakeup-moment could have on a family, and she heard about someone who had a moment like that over a decade ago. He tried to pull his family into activism too, and what unfolded was the most extreme example of things going badly in a family that Aviva heard of. If you or somebody you know might need help, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is available 24/7 at 1-800-273-8255. (42 minutes) _Aviva DeKornfeld_

Act Two
Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi takes Ira to an annual tradition in his hometown of Santa Fe, where people have figured out a surprisingly effective way to deal with the problems of the world, large and small. (8 minutes) _Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi_

      <description>In 2006, a new convert showed up at a mosque in Orange County, California. Known as Farouk al-Aziz, the convert was actually an FBI informant named Craig Monteilh. That informant’s infiltration of the mosque is at the heart of FBI v Fazaga, a case heard at the Supreme Court last month. We return to our episode from 2012, which tells the story behind it.

Prologue
At a Muslim community center in New York, two lawyers teach a workshop on how to react when an FBI agent shows up at the door asking questions. The workshop is a project of CLEAR — Creating Law Enforcement Accountability and Responsibility — at the City University of New York School of Law. (9 minutes)

Act One
In the summer of 2006, an FBI official visited a mosque in Orange County, California. His intention was to reassure the community that they weren't being spied on. But a few months later, an undercover informant named Craig Monteilh showed up at the mosque. Monteilh says he¹d been sent there to catch terrorists. But his behavior was so odd that Monteilh himself came under suspicion. Documentary filmmaker Sam Black reports the story. (25 minutes) _Sam Black_

Act Two

Act One
Vauhini Vara lost her sister when she was in college. Even though Vauhini’s a writer now, she’d never really been able to write about her sister. It’s hard to figure out what to say about something like that. Somehow, it was a computer program that helped her find the words. Tobin Low talked to her about it.

It's called The Immortal King Rao . (23 minutes) _Tobin Low_

      <description>In 2020, a series of violent, highly publicized killings of Black Americans sparked outrage and a national movement to eradicate racism and its evils. That movement gave way to a newer, reactionary one, a backlash that is playing out in schools and school board meetings across America. Host Emanuele Berry shares stories about Black people who got tangled up in this current backlash in both extreme and very personal ways.

Prologue
As a new high school principal, Dr. Whitfield felt moved by the national renouncement of racism he saw all around him in the wake of George Floyd’s murder. It prompted him to write a thoughtful email to parents and teachers in his district. He got lots of praise for it. Less than a year later, that same email would threaten his job. (12 minutes) _Emanuele Berry_

Act One
During her sophomore year in high school, Nevaeh was targeted in a secret text message chain by a handful of her peers. She’d come to learn the text chat was a mock slave trade where her photo and photos of other Black classmates were uploaded, talked about as property, and bid on. Emanuele Berry talks to Nevaeh about what these messages mean to her now as well as how she’s navigated her town’s reaction and her close friendships with kids who mostly aren’t Black. (20 minutes) _Emanuele Berry_

Act Two
After the murder of George Floyd, sales of books by Black authors skyrocketed. Now, there are efforts to ban many of the same books. Producer Chana Joffe-Walt talks to author Jerry Craft, who is caught up in this backlash with his graphic novel New Kid . (21 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt_

      <description>Last week's storycontinues, about a Michigan couple who walked into a police officer's house and made a disturbing discovery. This week: the police officer suffers the consequences and so does the couple.

Prologue
Ira summarizes part one of our story. (8 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
The police chief in Muskegon conducts his own personal investigation into Officer Anderson’s interactions with Black people on the job. He doesn’t like what he discovers. (6 minutes) _Ben Calhoun_

Act Two
Officer Anderson is fired based on the chief’s findings. But that’s not what’s said publicly. In fact, the official investigation released by the city makes no mention of Officer Anderson’s history with Black residents in Muskegon, much to the chagrin of some of the Black residents of Muskegon. (3 minutes)

Act Three
Muskegon’s chief of police explains why he decided he couldn’t mention any of the stuff he found troubling about Officer Anderson’s treatment of Black people on the job. No regrets! (6 minutes)

Act Four
Duke Stalling, whose mother’s birthday party was pepper sprayed by Officer Anderson when he showed up on a noise complaint, reacts to the city’s deal with Anderson. (6 minutes)

Act Five
Turns out, the couple who originally brought Officer Anderson into the spotlight with their Facebook post had encountered Anderson before in Muskegon. Specifically, at a traffic stop where things got ugly. This is publicized in the city’s official report on Anderson, and the Mathises suffer further threats and harassment as a result. (13 minutes)

Act Six
The Mathises consider if going public with what they found in Officer Anderson’s house was worth it, given what their personal lives have been like since. (5 minutes)

      <description>A while back, one of our producers Brian Reed was in England giving a speech about the podcast he'd hosted,S-Town. A journalism student approached him, asking for advice about a story he wanted to look into – something that’d been big news in Britain, something he’d thought about for years. Brian and the student, Hamza Syed, decided to team up to try and solve the mystery at the heart of that story. The original idea was to put this on our show, but it got too big. Too many twists and turns! This week, it rolls out as a spectacularly great podcast calledThe Trojan Horse Affair. We’re excited to bring you their first episode today.

Prologue
Ira introduces the first part of the latest podcast from Brian Reed ( S-Town ) and Hamza Syed — which all started when Hamza was a student with a burning question. (1 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Hamza and Brian visit Tahir Alam, the alleged mastermind of a plot to ‘Islamize’ Birmingham’s schools. Tahir lays out what led him to Park View School — and why he was so invested in transforming the culture and achievements of the school. (29 minutes) _Brian Reed, Hamza Syed_

Act Two
As Tahir’s revamp of Park View School continues to grow and deliver stunning results, his reputation grows — as does resentment at his blunt, unvarnished style. And then came the letter, and hoax or no, the consequences of its contents began to unravel Tahir’s life’s work almost immediately. (25 minutes)

      <description>Stories about Vladimir Putin. Did he come to power in 1999 by killing hundreds of innocent Russians? How’s he really seen in his home country? This show is a mix of old and new stories we’ve done about him.

Prologue
Late at night on the evening Russia invaded Ukraine, Ira talks to two people who escaped to Lviv, near the Polish border: a woman we call Natalie, and the Ukraine Correspondent for The Economist, Richard Ensor. Natalie’s harrowing story about escaping Kyiv is not the sort of war story that makes you think, "I can't imagine what it'd be like to go through that.” In fact it’s just the opposite. For anyone who’s ever lived in a sizable city, it’s shockingly, instantly easy to imagine, because every moment of her story happens in such familiar sorts of places. (11 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Back in 1999 there was series of bombings of apartment buildings in Moscow and across Russia. 300 people died. It happened just as Vladimir Putin was coming to power. And there was a question whether Putin or other people in the Kremlin might have been involved.  Producer Robyn Semien talked to reporters who covered the bombings and reviewed the evidence. (20 minutes) _Robyn Semien_

Act Two
Vladmir Putin’s approval rating among Russians is always stunningly high. Ira talks to reporter Charles Maynes to find out if that number is real and how it could be that high. Then Charles talks to a Putin supporter who explains why she loves her president. (10 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
Disinformation and propaganda works differently in Putin’s Russia than it did during the Soviet Union. Instead of tamping down the opposition, the Russian government works to control the opposition. Producer Sean Cole introduces us to Putin’s former right hand man who was credited with inventing this new way of controlling information. One of the journalists Sean speaks to in this story is Peter Pomerantsev. He’s the author of the book, " Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia ." (15 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Four
Protestors came out across Russia after the Ukraine invasion. In this act, that we first broadcast in 2017, we hear from young people who attended anti-government protests that swept through Russia. After the protests, teenagers posted videos online of their teachers lecturing them about the protests and the kids arguing back. Ira talks to reporter Joshua Yaffa about a video that one student filmed in the town of Bryansk. Joshua Yaffa wrote about the protest and the video for The New Yorker . (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One

      <description>Three people, and one animal, who know the path their lives will take until, suddenly, they don’t.

Prologue
Like a lot of parents, Yibin Li’s dad dedicated himself to making sure his daughter stayed on a path that would lead her to a better life than his.

Phoebe Judge, host of the “ This Is Love ” podcast, tells her story. (14 minutes) _Phoebe Judge, Alix Spiegel_

Act Three
Comedian Casey Wilson’s mom was a stabilizing force in her family. So after her unexpected death, both Casey and her father felt devastated and unmoored. But their grief took them on two wildly different paths. (20 minutes) _Casey Wilson, Elna Baker_

      <description>Government isn’t doing much to prevent school shootings. So parents are jumping in: parents whose kids have died in mass shootings, in the wake of each shooting. They take practical, effective action — and they get results.

Prologue
There's a whole infrastructure that springs into action when a mass shooting occurs. There's the police and SWAT teams, the Red Cross, the Billy Graham prayer truck, therapy dogs. And then there’s a couple – Sandy and Lonnie Phillips – whose daughter died in a mass shooting. What they do seems to really help. (2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Sandy and Lonnie’s daughter, Jessi, died back in 2012, when a gunman opened fire in a movie theater in Aurora, Colo. Since then, they’ve organized their whole lives to be able to reach out to other parents like themselves. Producer Miki Meek traveled with them to Sante Fe, Texas, right after a school shooting. (23 minutes) _Miki Meek_

Act Two
Lenny Pozner’s son, Noah, was killed at Sandy Hook. In the years after his death, Lenny and his family were harassed by people who believed the shooting at Sandy Hook never happened – that it was all a conspiracy. Until one day, Lenny decided to fight back. (29 minutes) _Miki Meek_

      <description>Getting from A to B via Z.

Prologue
Ira talks with Cassidy, a 10-year-old who has to take a very long route when he encounters an unfamiliar word in a book. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
A man in Mississippi tries to get his right to vote back. The state constitution provides a way to do that. But it's a long road. You have to get your own personal bill passed by the house and senate. Reporter Johnny Kauffman follows one man trying to do just that. (23 minutes) _Johnny Kauffman, David Kestenbaum_

Act Two
Yang Yi, in China, tells the story of a strange journey he took that started at home and ended at home.  But somehow took a very long path. Yang Yi’s podcast is called Go LIVE . (17 minutes) _Yang Yi, Emanuele Berry_

Act Three
For most of their history, salmon were born upstream and swam to the ocean before coming back as adults to spawn. But humans have disrupted the route the salmon take to the ocean. Writer Jaime Lowe loves salmon and got a look at the unnerving solution we’ve devised to try to get these fish where they need to go. Jaime Lowe is the author of Breathing Fire: Female Inmate Firefighters on the Front Lines of California’s Wildfires . Note: Thanks to everyone who wrote in to say the local pronunciation of "Mokelumne River" is more like this . (9 minutes) _Jaime Lowe, Alix Spiegel_

      <description>The Supreme Court case that overturned Roe v. Wade began with a lawsuit filed by a Mississippi abortion clinic. On the day Roe was overturned, we were there. Stories from the center of this moment of history, the day it happened.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass reminds us that, before they change the country, all major Supreme Court cases start with just a person, in a place. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Documentarian Maisie Crow has been following the fight to stay open by the Jackson Women’s Health Clinic, for ten years. Now the Supreme Court decision is forcing their doors shut for good. She brings us inside as the staff prepares for the day the decision comes down, and then lives through it. Maisie Crow's movie about abortion in Mississippi, which follows the Pink House and Shannon Brewer, is called Jackson . (20 minutes) _Maisie Crow, Miki Meek, Lilly Sullivan_

Act Two
Our producer Zoe Chace goes to Fairview Heights, Illinois, where Planned Parenthood has opened a massive new abortion clinic just across the river from Missouri. Abortion is banned in Missouri and lots of the surrounding states now that Roe has been overturned. Illinois is gearing up to get lots and lots of patients now. (5 minutes) _Zoe Chace_

Act Three
Zoe Chace spends time with a lawmaker in Missouri on the day Roe fell who’d worked her whole life for this moment and can’t believe it’s really here. (5 minutes) _Zoe Chace_

Act Four
Host Ira Glass walks through possible next steps with a pro-life activist who worked on the Texas SB8 bill, that set a precedent for enforcement of abortion bans throughout the country. (8 minutes) _Ira Glass, Zoe Chace_

Act Five
Rebecca Grant introduces us to an abortion pill smuggler, who walks us through her undercover operation to mail pills to people who want medication abortions in places where it's hard to get them. (9 minutes) _Rebecca Grant, Aviva DeKornfeld_

Act Six
Emma Green spends time with Anja Baker, who’s working on preparing Mississippi for the influx of babies it will have to absorb now that abortion is illegal in that state. (9 minutes) _Emma Green, Diane Wu_

Act Seven
Maisie Crow is back to take us inside the Jackson clinic once again, as they rally themselves to see all the patients they’d scheduled for the next month to come in in the next ten days, before the ban goes into effect. (3 minutes) _Maisie Crow, Miki Meek_

      <description>Not long ago, Republicans in Ohio passed a constitutional amendment to end gerrymandering in the state. And then a funny thing happened. The same Ohio Republicans drew electoral maps that violated their own constitutional amendment. They’ll be using them in this week’s midterm elections. We try to understand how that could happen.

Prologue
Ira Glass brings us back to the moment of celebration when the anti-gerrymandering constitutional amendment was passed in Ohio. And then walks us through how the subsequent maps were struck down over and over by the Ohio State Supreme Court for gerrymandering. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Anti-gerrymandering activists in Ohio worked for decades to pass a constitutional amendment to curb gerrymandering. Then Republican lawmaker Matt Huffman came along and finally made it happen. (12 minutes)

Act Two
In 2021, Ohio got a chance to take its new constitutional amendments out for a spin for the first time, and draw non-gerrymandered maps. Ira Glass tells the story of what went wrong, including an eleventh-hour Hail Mary vote. (38 minutes)

      <description>Something we’ve never done before: true stories told in the form of a game show.

Prologue
Jiayang Fan has this theory that because she's spent so much time thinking about her own accent when she speaks English, she believes that when she hears other Chinese-Americans speak, she can tell how old they were when they immigrated to the U.S. (7 minutes)

Act One
We test Jiayang Fan’s self-proclaimed special skill by having her listen to three Chinese-Americans speak, and then guss when they came to the U.S. (20 minutes) _Jiayang Fan, Tobin Low_

Act Two
Is it possible for the U.S. to reach the goals set by the Paris Agreement? What steps would we have to take to cut emissions by 50% by 2030? We challenge climate researcher Melissa Lott to get us to that number. (11 minutes) _Diane Wu_

Act Three
A game of telephone played on the podcast Normal Gossip reveals how gossip spreads, and why stories change from person to person. (15 minutes) _Sean Cole_

      <description>People experiencing Christmas in brand new ways, giving the holiday even more meaning.

Prologue
Ira introduces us to Santa Allen. A man who is NOT the real Santa Claus but who will – for the first time ever – be sitting in a chair, dressed as Santa, asking little children what they want for Christmas this year.  He’s nervous. (4 minutes)

Act One
Producer Aviva DeKornfeld accompanies Santa Allen to his first “chair gig” to see whether all of his hopes, or all of his fears, or a little of both, will be realized. (16 minutes) _Aviva DeKornfeld_

Act Two
Alex Edelman grew up in an Orthodox Jewish household in Boston. But one year, unexpectedly, his family decided to celebrate Christmas – for what he says are very Jewish reasons. (15 minutes) _Alex Edelman, Ira Glass_

Act Three
Our former colleague Neil Drumming has never seen “It’s a Wonderful Life” – which makes no sense given that he’s seen almost every other movie there is. Executive Editor Emanuele Berry takes it upon herself to change Neil’s life forever, or not at all, by showing him the film for the first time. (10 minutes) _Emanuele Berry_

Act Four
Scaachi Koul is commemorating a Christmas first of her own – and ON her own – this year. _Scaachi Koul, Diane Wu_

Prologue
Ira talks to author Etgar Keret about his mom, and the stories she used to tell him when she put him to sleep.  He explains why it's always been so hard to write about her. _Ira Glass, Etgar Keret_

      <description>When it comes to finding love, there seems to be two schools of thought on the best way to go about it. One says, wait for that lightning-strike magic. The other says, make a calculation and choose the best option available. Who has it right?

Prologue
When guest host Tobin Low was looking for a husband, he got opposing advice from two of the most important people in his life, his mom and his best friend. (8 minutes) _Tobin Low_

Act Two
People who fall in love at first sight often describe it as a kind of magic. One of our producers, Aviva DeKornfeld, is skeptical of these sorts of claims. And also a little envious. (10 minutes) _Aviva DeKornfeld_

Act Three
Calvin is an 11 year old who is learning what love is all about, the hard way. (7 minutes) _Tobin Low_

Act Four
Writer Marie Phillips believes that magic is not just reserved for the beginning of a relationship. In fact, she says the real magic can be found  in the end, once you decide to finally leave. (8 minutes) _Diane Wu_

      <description>It’s been nine months since Roe v. Wade was overturned. We talk to people who wanted abortions right when the laws were changing in their states. They had to wait for appointments, for money to travel or abortion pills. And during that waiting, a lot of interesting things happened. We see how much life has changed, nine months later.

Prologue
Nine months ago, these people wanted abortions. But then, the laws changed. They had to wait to get an appointment, figure out how to get out of state or order abortion pills.  In that waiting, other things happened. Today’s show was inspired by the excellent reporting of Caroline Kitchener. You can read more of her work at The Washington Post . (5 minutes)

Act One
In the months following the court’s decision, two women are stalled getting abortions. Reporter Caroline Kitchener follows Kae and Taylor in those early months, as they try to figure out what to do. And we see what happens when both women each come into contact with the anti-abortion movement. (19 minutes) _Caroline Kitchener_

Act Two
Doctors say one effect of the new bans is people seeking abortions much later into their second trimesters. Caroline got interested in a girl like that in Oklahoma. We recorded the Abortion and Miscarriage hotline with the Nocturnists Podcast . (18 minutes)

Act Three
It’s been nine months since the first group of people who wanted abortions couldn’t get them in their states. How have their lives changed, or not. (12 minutes)

      <description>A week after Jerry Springer’s death, we go back to a story we first broadcast years ago, about a side of Springer most people don’t know and can’t imagine: his years as an idealistic politician in the mold of Bobby Kennedy. Plus other stories of people who try to leave some moment in their life behind, which can be hard.

Prologue
Ira explains the premise of this week’s show, where most of the stories were first broadcast in 2004. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Alex Blumberg tells the true story of Jerry Springer's life before he was a talk show host. It's the story of an idealistic and serious Jerry Springer, a progressive politician, and the most popular mayor ever of a certain American city. (31 minutes) _Alex Blumberg_

Act Two
Ira talks with Shalom Auslander, who was raised as an Orthodox Jew and who made a pivotal break with his faith at a Rangers game. Shalom Auslander is the author of several books, including Foreskin's Lament where he tells this story, and his latest Mother for Dinner . (6 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
The journalist E. Jean Carroll is in court this week with her rape case against Donald Trump. In 2020 she published a series of stories interviewing women who’ve accused President Trump of sexual assault or harassment. At the time, she felt like these stories had been so widely covered that people had gotten used to them and ignored them. Which seemed sort of incredible to her. Back then she adapted one of the stories for our show and we’re replaying it today, a frank conversation with another one of the president’s accusers, Jessica Leeds, who also testified in Carroll’s case against Trump. The story is adapted from a series in The Atlantic . E. Jean Carroll is the author of the memoir What Do We Need Men For? and runs a Substack newsletter . (16 minutes) _Susan Burton_

Back in 2021, a 19-year-old intern at the Idaho state legislature reported that a state Representative named Aaron von Ehlinger raped her. She went by the name Jane Doe. There was a public ethics hearing and Ehlinger resigned. State legislators talked about how proud they were of their ability to do the right thing so quickly. But the story that the public knows is very different from what actually happened to Jane. She talks about it in-depth for the first time. (25 minutes) _Miki Meek_

Act Two
Jane Doe walks into a public ethics hearing at the Idaho state capitol and navigates the aftermath. Song: “Here We Have Idaho” Fiona Apple (vocals) Amy Wood (drums and percussion) David Garza (acoustic guitar, electric guitar, piano, vocals) Sabastian Steinberg (bass, electric autoharp, vocals) John Would (tremolo guitar) Engineered by John Would, Amy Wood, Fiona Apple Mixed and mastered by John Would (23 minutes) _Miki Meek_

Act Three
Jane Doe sent some questions for us to ask Chanel Miller. For years, Chanel was known as Emily Doe. She wrote a victim impact statement that millions of people read. (A swimmer at Stanford University named Brock Turner sexually assaulted her while she was unconscious.) She talks about how she decided to come out with her real name and who Emily Doe is to her now. Chanel Miller is the author of the memior Know My Name . Editor for this episode: Chana Joffe-Walt If you’ve experienced sexual assault and want to talk to someone, you can reach out to the National Sexual Assault Hotline: 1-800-656-HOPE. If you’re having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline by dialing or texting 988 on your phone. (9 minutes) _Ira Glass, Valerie Kipnis_

      <description>Five years after the #MeToo explosion, what’s happened in the lives of the women who stepped forward and went public with their stories? We tell the story of a teenager who spoke out against one of the most powerful people in her state, and what happened next.

Prologue
Some powerful and well known men lost their jobs after #MeToo. But what about the women at the center of all this who’ve been way less visible after they told what happened to them? We hear about big and small ways the aftermath of coming forward continues to pop up in their daily lives. Jules Woodson’s nonprofit is Help; Hear; Heal . Tanya Selvaratnam is the author of the memoir Assume Nothing: A Story of Intimate Violence . (10 minutes) _Ira Glass, Valerie Kipnis_

      <description>Humans encounter non-human intelligences of various kinds and try to make sense of them.

Prologue
Ira has some thoughts about our country’s long history of alien invasion movies. (2 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
We’ve witnessed a revolution in A.I. since the public rollout of ChatGPT.  Our Senior Editor David Kestenbaum thinks that even though there’s been a ton of coverage, there’s one thing people haven’t talked much about: have these machines gotten to the point that they’re starting to have something like human intelligence? Where they actually understand language and concepts, and can reason? He talks with scientists at Microsoft who’ve been trying to figure that out. (30 minutes) _David Kestenbaum_

Act Two
A short piece of fiction from the perspective of aliens who’ve been scouting Earth, from writer Terry Bisson. It’s called “They're Made Out of Meat.” It’s performed by actors Maeve Higgins and H Jon Benjamin. More information about Terry Bisson on his website . His latest novel is Any Day Now. Maeve Higgins’ comedy album is A Very Special Woman . H Jon Benjamin plays the title characters in the TV shows Bob’s Burgers and Archer . He is also the Jazz Daredevil on Sub Pop Records. (5 minutes) _Terry Bisson_

Act Three
A species of massive, mysterious, highly intelligent beings have recently been making contact with humanity. Or our boats, anyway. Many people seem convinced they are seeking revenge for past injustices. Producer Chris Benderev wondered if that was true. April Boyes documents her sailing on her blog, Beyond The Boyes . (7 minutes) _Chris Benderev_

Act Four
Many of us, especially when we’re young, feel like we’re the alien, trying to understand and fit in with the humans on this planet. Producer Diane Wu spent some time recently with a teenage humanoid who feels that way. (15 minutes) _Diane Wu_

      <description>At a Yale fertility clinic, dozens of women began their I.V.F. cycles full of expectation and hope. Then a surgical procedure caused them excruciating pain. In the hours that followed, some of the women called the clinic to report their pain — but most of the staff members who fielded the patients’ reports did not know the real reason for the pain, which was that a nurse at the clinic was stealing fentanyl and replacing it with saline. What happened at that clinic? What are the stories we tell about women's pain and what happens when we minimize or dismiss it?The Retrievals, a new five-part series from Serial Productions, is hosted and reported by longtimeThis American Lifeproducer and editor Susan Burton. We're excited to bring you the first episode today.

Prologue
Ira Glass introduces the first episode of a new podcast from longtime This American Life producer and editor Susan Burton. (1 minutes)

Act One
Susan Burton introduces some of the many women who went to a Yale fertility clinic for IVF treatment, and charts their experience from hopeful beginning to excruciatingly painful egg retrieval. (27 minutes) _Susan Burton_

Act Two
Often bypassing logic, the women go to great lengths to construct elaborate stories to make sense of their inexplicable pain. And then, a letter arrives. (25 minutes) _Susan Burton_

      <description>Governor Ron DeSantis is running for president on the argument that he'll do for America what he's done for Florida. So what's it like in Florida?

Prologue
Florida is now the fastest growing state, and DeSantis says people are moving there from all over because of him. We speak to people who did make the move, at least in part, for DeSantis’s policies. (6 minutes) _Ira Glass, Alaa Mostafa_

Act One
Among the big items in DeSantis's run for president is medical freedom. Producer Zoe Chace wanted to understand its appeal and its growing popularity. So she spent some time in Sarasota County, where one man — at the side of former Trump appointee Mike Flynn — is creating a sort of little parallel universe for this very thing. (33 minutes) _Zoe Chace_

Act Two
DeSantis has passed law after law about what can and can’t be taught in Florida classrooms, starting as early as elementary school. And last spring, Florida Republicans introduced a bill initially proposing to ban things like critical race theory and identity politics, or students majoring in things like gender studies in Florida universities. Reporter Emmanuel Dzotsi followed how things unfolded at one of the biggest universities there, Florida State, from the bill’s introduction all the way to its passage. He explains how professors and students have been preparing. (25 minutes) _Emmanuel Dzotsi_

Act Three
Among the legislation introduced by DeSantis that has passed is a ban on minors receiving transition care. The bill passed into law a few months ago. We speak with a teen whose family has since had to flee the state in order to access the care they needed. (2 minutes) _Ira Glass, Ike Sriskandarajah_

      <description>Friends and ex-friends finally talk about the one thing between them they've been avoiding.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass tells a story he’s never told anyone before, about something someone said to him. (4 minutes)

It's called The Last Cup / La ultima copa , and it tells the story of Leo Messi: his journey to stardom, his World Cup victory after many attempts with his home country, and what his story says about immigrants everywhere.

A middle schooler really wants to trust the adults have her best interests in mind. But some of the most powerful people at her school begin to make that very difficult. Talia Richman originally wrote about Madison for The Dallas Morning News . (27 minutes) _Talia Richman, Chris Benderev, Bethel Habte_

Act Two

      <description>During the highest turkey consumption period of the year, we bring you aThis American Lifetradition: stories of turkeys, chickens, geese, ducks, fowl of all kinds—real and imagined—and their mysterious hold over us.

Prologue
Ira Glass talks with Scharlette Holdman, who works with defense teams on high profile death row cases, and who has not talked to a reporter in more than 25 years. Why did she suddenly end the moratorium on press? Because her story is about something important: namely, a beautiful chicken. (2 minutes)

Act One
Scharlette Holdman's story continues, in which she and the rest of a legal defense team try to save a man on death row by finding a star witness — a chicken with a specific skill. (10 minutes)

Act Two
Yet another testimony to the power chickens have over our hearts and minds.  Jack Hitt reports on an opera about Chicken Little.  It's performed with dressed-up styrofoam balls, it's sung in Italian and, no kidding, able to make grown men cry. The official website for the opera "Love's Fowl" by Susan Vitucci and Henry Krieger is pulcina.org . (14 minutes)

Act Three
Ira accompanies photographer Tamara Staples as she attempts to photograph chickens in the style of high fashion photography. The chickens are not very cooperative. Tamara's photos have been collected in a book, The Magnificent Chicken: Portraits of the Fairest Fowl . (15 minutes)

Act Four
Kathie Russo's husband was Spalding Gray,  who was best known for delivering monologues onstage—like "Monster in a Box," and "Swimming to Cambodia." On January 10, 2004, he went missing. Witnesses said they saw him on the Staten Island Ferry that night. Two months later, his body was pulled out of the East River. Kathie tells the story of the night he disappeared, and about how, in the weeks following, she and each of their three children were visited by a bird, who seemed to be delivering a message to them. (9 minutes)

      <description>A major political party in a major swing state bets on a new leader: a total political outsider. How does that work out for them?

Prologue

Act Two
Two young Michigan GOP vice chairs are totally on board with Kristina Karamo’s take on politics and hate the establishment like her. So why do they feel iced out by her? (15 minutes)

Act Three
At the start of the year, Warren Carpenter was a Kristina Karamo supporter; helped her get elected. Now he’s plotting her ouster. (13 minutes)

Act Four
Kristina Karamo and her camp defend themselves against Warren’s attacks that they’re bad at fundraising and bad at leading the party. (13 minutes)

      <description>The trial for the men accused of orchestrating the September 11 terrorist attacks still hasn’t started yet.

      <description>Donald Trump has talked about taking retribution on his enemies since the early days of his 2024 presidential campaign. After his conviction last week in New York, his talk intensified. We try to understand what his retribution might look like by speaking with people who have the most to lose in a second Trump administration: people who believe Trump will be coming for them.

Prologue
Donald Trump has talked about taking revenge on his enemies since the early days of his 2024 presidential campaign. Ira Glass talks to reporter Jonathan Karl about how Trump has placed retribution at the center of his run and what we know about how he’s thinking about it. (16 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Reporter Alix Spiegel talks to two people with good reason to fear a second Trump administration. Former White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham spent six years with the Trumps but resigned after January 6th and wrote a scathing tell-all book about her experience. Fred Wellman worked for The Lincoln Project - a group of high-profile Republicans who pledged to keep Trump out of office during the 2020 campaign. (22 minutes) _Alix Spiegel_

Act Two
Alex Vindman became the face of the first Trump impeachment after he reported to his superiors that Trump had asked the President of Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of his political opponent. At the time, Vindman believed that his Congressional testimony would not jeopardize him; now, he and his wife Rachel are having second thoughts. (14 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Three
After hearing from people who dread a possible second Trump term, we hear from those who are excited about it. Reporter Zoe Chace checks into whether his supporters are excited for retribution. (7 minutes) _Zoe Chace_

      <description>Iowa has three million people and a million come to their State Fair, each with their own goals and dreams for the fair. We hang out with some of them, to see if they get what they hoped for.

Prologue
A big bull, a giant slide, and cowboys on horseback shooting balloons are just a few sights you can take in at the Iowa State Fair. Some people come for the spectacle, and some are the spectacle. (8 minutes) _Ira Glass, Diane Wu, Ike Sriskandarajah_

Act One
Bailey Leavitt comes from a family of carnies. For her, one of the most thrilling things she looks for at the fair is someone who is really good at luring people into spending money at their stand. She takes Ira on an insider’s search for “an agent.” (16 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Two
What life lessons can kids learn at the 4-H rabbit competition? A lot. (11 minutes) _Dana Chivvis_

Act Three
The Iowa State Fair awarded coveted slots to just nine new food vendors this year. All of them are run by people who already own restaurants or who’ve done other big fairs. All except for an unlikely newcomer: Biscuit Bar. (19 minutes) _Chris Benderev_

Act Four
As the ferris wheel goes dark and the fair is closing down, one game is racing to meet their quota. Ira watches until the end. (3 minutes) _Ira Glass_

      <description>Chen Almog-Goldstein was kidnapped by Hamas along with her three youngest children on October 7, 2023. This week, she tells the story of their life as hostages in Gaza.

The 251 hostages taken by Hamas a year ago have become a divisive symbol in Israel. Host Ira Glass talks about the father of one hostage, and what happened to him at a protest last week when he called for a hostage deal. (6 minutes)

Act One
On this week’s show, we’re airing excerpts of interviews with former hostages produced by an Israeli podcast, Echad Bayom. In these interviews they describe, in a remarkably detailed and complicated way, what happened to them a year ago. We start with Chen Almog-Goldstein. She tells the story of being kidnapped from her home in kibbutz Kfar Aza, and taken to Gaza, along with three of her children. (8 minutes)

Act Two
Chen’s story continues, with a description of what it was like to be hidden in a small apartment with her children and their captors. (6 minutes)

Act Three
Chen talks about the complicated relationship between her family and the people holding them hostage. (6 minutes)

Act Four

      <description>So much of the fight for the presidency is coming down to battles for small slices of voters who can help throw swing states to one candidate or another. Abbas Alawieh, a leader in the Uncommitted movement, grapples with how to get his voters the thing they want.

Prologue
When you have some power, but not a lot, how do you wield it when you’re suddenly cast into the spotlight? (4 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
Zoe Chace and Ben Terris follow Abbas Alawieh as he fights to broker a deal at the DNC – a way to potentially satisfy the people who voted “Uncommitted” in the primaries as a protest vote against Biden’s handling of the war in Israel and Gaza. (33 minutes) _Ben Terris, Zoe Chace_

Act Two
Three weeks after the Democratic National Convention, Abbas speaks at a tense community meeting in Michigan about the Uncommitted organizers’ general election recommendation and hears back from voters on how they feel about the Democratic nominee at this point. (15 minutes)

      <description>With Donald Trump’s victory this week, many people looked at the election results and thought, yeah, this is the country I thought it was. For some people, that was a hopeful thing. For others, kind of the opposite. This week, we talked with people who helped make it happen and some who are looking to what’s next.

Prologue
Ira talks with Zoe Chace about watching Trump’s victory from an ecstatic room in Michigan. Then he checks in with a DC cop who was injured at the Capitol on January 6. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass, Zoe Chace_

Act One
Trump has claimed that he will be able to deport between 15 and 20 million people. But neither he nor his team have spelled out exactly how they’d do it. Producer Nadia Reiman looked into what mass deportation could actually look like on the ground if and when it comes to pass. (17 minutes) _Nadia Reiman_

Act Two
Trump won record numbers of Latino voters this year. Ike Sriskandarajah spent the day with a guy in Pennsylvania who's been working to bring Latino voters to Trump for years. (15 minutes) _Ike Sriskandarajah_

Act Three
Ira talks with two of Trump’s “political enemies” about their post-election plans. (8 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act Four
Ten different states had abortion rights measures on their ballots this election. Producer Miki Meek got curious about a particular kind of political ad that aired in many of those states and called up a few of the women whose stories were featured in them. We first learned about Deborah Dorbert and Kimberly Paseka from articles in The Washington Post. (9 minutes) _Miki Meek, Dana Chivvis, Henry Larson_

      <description>People immersed in chaos try to solve for what it all adds up to.

Prologue
A scientist who is used to organizing data starts tracking scientific meetings that seem to exist only on paper—meetings that might decide the fate of years of research. The NIH website shows one reality; the empty conference rooms tell another story. She graphs the chaos. We first heard about Annika Barber in a story by Stephanie M. Lee for The Chronicle . (9 minutes) _Chana Joffe-Walt_

Act One
American doctors returning from Gaza compare notes and start to see a pattern. (28 minutes) _Ike Sriskandarajah_

Act Two
A woman watches her partner get taken in handcuffs with no explanation. Days later, she spots him in the most unexpected place. The coordinates of her life suddenly don't make sense as she navigates the bewildering map of the US immigration system. (23 minutes) _Nadia Reiman_

      <description>On his first day in office, President Trump decided to freeze all U.S. foreign aid. Soon after, his administration effectively dissolved USAID—the federal agency that delivers billions in food, medicine, and other aid worldwide. Many of its programs have been canceled. Now, as USAID officially winds down, we try to assess its impact. What was good? What was not so good? We meet people around the world wrestling with these questions and trying to navigate this chaotic moment.

Prologue
Just one box of a specially enriched peanut butter paste can save the life of a severely malnourished child. So why have 500,000 of those boxes been stuck in warehouses in Rhode Island? (13 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
USAID was founded in 1961. Since then, it has spent hundreds of billions of dollars all over the world. What did that get us? Producer David Kestenbaum talked with Joshua Craze and John Norris about that. Joshua Craze's article for the New York Review of Books is " USAID: Goodbye to All That? " John Norris wrote the book The Enduring Struggle - The History of the U.S. Agency for International Development and America’s Uneasy Transformation of the World . (12 minutes) _David Kestenbaum_

Act Two
Two Americans moved to Eswatini when that country was the epicenter of the AIDS epidemic. With support from USAID, they built a clinic and started serving HIV+ patients. Now that US support for their clinic has ended, they are wondering if what they did was entirely a good thing. Chico Harlan wrote about USAID in Eswatini for The Washington Post. (27 minutes) _Diane Wu, Chico Harlan_

Act Three
When USAID suddenly stopped all foreign assistance without warning or a transition plan, it sent people all over the world scrambling. Especially those relying on daily medicine provided by USAID. Producer Ike Sriskandarajah spoke to two families in Kenya who were trying to figure it out. Katharine Houreld wrote about cuts to PEPFAR in Kenya for The Washington Post . (8 minutes) _Ike Sriskandarajah_

      <description>When Zohran Mamdani won the primary race for New York mayor, the Democratic establishment's lukewarm response echoed the treatment of another charismatic, unconventional candidate decades earlier. This week, we bring you the story of Harold Washington, the greatest politician you've probably never heard of, and the backlash that ensued when he became Chicago's first Black mayor.

Prologue
As New York City’s Democratic establishment attempts to resist the candidacy of Zohran Mamdani, we look back at another mayoral candidate who upset the established political machine. (7 minutes) _Ira Glass_

Act One
A history of the brief mayoral career of Harold Washington and its lessons for Black and white America, as told by people close to him. Harold Washington died on November 25, 1987.  This show was first broadcast ten years later, in 1997. (39 minutes)

Act Two
Ira revisits interviews with Chicago voters from the 1997 and 2007 rebroadcasts of this episode. In 1997, ten years after Harold Washington’s death, not much had changed in Chicago. By 2007, attitudes had begun to shift slowly, and another Black politician from Chicago was on the rise — Barack Obama. Ira also speaks to David Axelrod, an advisor to both Harold Washington and Barack Obama. Song: “Chicago” sung by Harold Washington at his second inauguration (10 minutes)
