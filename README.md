# ThisAmericanScraper-JSON
This American Life is a great podcast, but the feed does often leave much to be desired. For instance, we don't have a list of dates the episodes aired. We also don't have one feed that is just for the clean episodes. No idea what the parents out there are doing, but that should exist. 

I wanted an easily searchable dataset where I could find every segment from a specific contributor without having to dig around too much. 


To Do
====

* compare acts to mark updated episodes vs repeats
* rename repo to *That* American Scraper
